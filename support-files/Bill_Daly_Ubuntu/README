I've been working on apl code that will reset the X windows keyboard so that
one may use the 'Windows' key as an additional shift key for the Functions an
operators.

I've tested the attached workspace on Debian and Ubuntu with success. I'm
hoping that some one will test other distributions. The code calls  setxkbmap
so the first test is at the command line:

dalyw@andelot:~$ setxkbmap -query
rules:      evdev
model:      pc105
layout:     us

An example session:

      kbd_on
0
      '∘∘∘∆∆∆∇∇∇'        ⍝ To test the windows key
∘∘∘∆∆∆∇∇∇
      kbd_off
      'jjjhhhggg'        ⍝ To test the windows key
jjjhhhggg

This change survives the current session so )off has no effect nor does
logging out.  Rebooting will reset X winodows and your keyboard mapping.

Please send me your results.
