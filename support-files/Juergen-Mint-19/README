As of Mint-19 (Gnome) xmodmap has stopped working. The file 'us' in this
directory is a 1:1 replacement for the .xmodmap file that I used in the
last 10 years.

The file 'us' provides the following keyboard layout:

  the standard US layout
+ additional APL symbols as found on a Dyalog US keyboard
+ German "Umlaute and a few extra keys on the numeric keypad

I have tried to use the "proper way" with setxkbmap (as described, for
example, in the directory 'Dirk', but could not get it working. My very
personal solution was then to "hack" all additional keys (APL, Umlaute)
directly into the US base keyboard.

In my old .xmodmap file, the keys that switch to APL were hardwired to
be both ALT keys. With the 'us' file in this directory it seems as if
one can choose different keys to switch to APL characters. That is, of
course, an advantage. I cannot predict, though, for how long it will
be working.


Installation (from this directory):

1. sudo mv /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us   /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us.orig
2. sudo cp ./us   /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us
3. select switch key(s) in: Control Center → Hardware → Keyboard → Layouts
                                           → Options → Key to choose 3rd Level.
4. reboot
