Keyboard
========

For a really luxurious keyboard experience, the APL keyboard should be
installed system-wide. The instructions below apply to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 
for which 

    XKB=/usr/share/X11/xkb 

For other systems, adapt the instructions after reading [Daniel 
O'Donnell's informative tutorial](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Blog/custom-keyboard-in-linuxx11).

Unified US APL keyboard
-----------------------

The following files for use with `setxkbmap` are provided:

`system-apl`
:   Defines `apl` to have variants `APL_on_3rd` (APL characters are 3rd
    and 4th level symbols) and `line_drawing` (line drawing symbols are 
    on numeric keypad, for easy use with NumLock). The keyboard layout 
    is the one shown by the GNU APL system command `]KEYB`.
`system-us`
:   Defines `us` to have variant `usapl`, which loads the preceding
    two variants on top of a default US keyboard and sets LeftAlt
    as the Level 3 selector.
`rules-evdev.xml`
:   Make variant `usapl` selectable from the "Text Entry Settings"
    menu under the name "APL (3rd/4th level)".
`rules-evdev.lst`
:   This is a human-friendly list of variants, not actually used by 
    any program.

Backup the following fies so that you can recover them if necessary.

    $XKB/symbols/apl
    $XKB/symbols/us
    $XKB/rules/evdef.lst
    $XKB/rules/evdef.xml

Replace the files by the provided files, i.e. `symbols-apl` replaces 
the existing  `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/apl` etc.

In order to register the changes with the X server, run
    
    sudo rm /var/lib/xkb/server-*
    udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change

You can now load the US APL keyboard with

    setxkbmap us usapl

Level 3 and Compose keys
------------------------

The new APL keyboard is only available if you have a Level 3 selector
key. This is set, as is the Compose key, when you install Ubuntu.  
The power-on settings can be viewed in `/etc/default/keyboard`. 
If you don't like them, don't just edit that file. The right way under 
Ubuntu 14.04 is to run
 
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration 

The same menu is offered that was available at install time.

From Ubuntu 8.10 to at least Ubuntu 12.04, it was possible to select 
the Level 3 modifier key and Compose keys from the System Settings menu. 
Why this highly useful feature was abolished remains a mystery.

Changing the default settings is not enough if your preferred Level 3 
and Compose keys have been grabbed by Unity (Ubuntu's desktop manager) 
for its own purposes. One should run `ccsm` and select `Ubuntu Unity 
Plugin` to seize them back. For example, I changed "Key to show the 
menu bar while pressed" to "Menu" (which I find more logical than the 
default "Alt") in order to free up LeftAlt.

Choosing the APL keyboard from the Language icon
------------------------------------------------

The menu used by `Text Entry Settings` is accessible from the 
language icon on the top bar. One can add several keyboards, and 
switch between them by clicking the language icon and making one's 
selection. The changed files in the `$XKB` will offer an option
`APL (3rd/4th level)`, available in the "Input sources", but only 
properly displayed in the Language Icon after the X server has 
been restarted, for example by rebooting.

The language icon can display the layout of the selected keyboard
from the language icon. This layout is the one defined in the files
under `$XKB/symbols` and does not reflect temporary changes that you
may have made manually by `xmodmap` or `setxkbmap`.
