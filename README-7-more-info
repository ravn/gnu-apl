If you have reached this file, then GNU APL is hopefully running well for
you and you may have more questions that are related to APL in general
rather than to GNU APL in particular.

The following is a list of web links that may be used as starting points
for more information on the web. This list is admittedly rather arbitrary
and by no means complete.


ISO Standard 13751
------------------

The ISO standard implemented by GNU APL can be found here:

    www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ljdickey/apl-rep/docs/is13751.pdf

Note that this file is, despite of its .pdf extension, a gzip compressed
PDF file. You have to fetch it, rename it, and then gunzip it:

    wget www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ljdickey/apl-rep/docs/is13751.pdf
    mv is13751.pdf is13751.pdf.gz
    gunzip is13751.pdf.gz


IBM Documentation
-----------------

In cases where the ISO 13751 standard was not clear, the IBM documents
for APL2 were consulted as a second opinion:

Dyalog APL Manual
-----------------

Dyalog Ltd. a commercial APL vendor, has published a book describing
their APL in great detail. Not all features described there are implemented
in GNU APL, but this book is a good starting point for beginners.

comp.lang.apl
-------------

An always interesting APL related newsgroup which has been around for
many years is:

    groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.apl
