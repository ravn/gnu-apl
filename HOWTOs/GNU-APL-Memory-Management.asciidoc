= Memory Management in GNU APL
:Author: Jürgen Sauermann, GNU APL
:page-width: 80em

== Abstract

This document describes how memory is being managed in GNU APL and what
the consequences for an GNU APL programmer are.

== Fundamentals

* The GNU APL interpreter is an executable that runs in a single process.
  Inside the interpreter run a handful of threads; the memory overhead of
  these threads can be neglected.

* Depending on configuration details and user preferences, the interpreter may
  fork additional processes (APserver, GTK_server) whose sizes are so small
  that they can also be neglected.

The sizes of the binaries mentioned (at the time of this writing) are:

.Binary Sizes
[options="header"]
[width="60%"]
|===============
| Binary             | Size (bytes) 
|GNU APL Interpreter |18,960,921
|APserver            |   832,886
|Gtk_server          |   138,502
|===============

* After the interpreter has started it requests additional memory from the
  operating system on behalf of APL commands and APL code executed. That
  memory is allocated by malloc(), either directly or indirectly (via C++
  new()). When the memory is no longer needed the it is returned to the
  malloc() memory management (for later re-use). The memory kept in the 
  malloc() memory management is only returned to the operating system when the
  GNU APL interpreter exits.

* GNU APL tries to allocate memory statically as much as possible. The
  static allocation has already taken place when the interpreter outputs its
  first APL prompt. After that dynamic memory allocation via malloc()/new()
  is performed for objects whose lifetime is potentially infinite (i.e. whose
  destruction is triggered by APL code. These objects are:
** APL variables
** APL values
** defined functions
** call stack (aka. )SI stack) entries of defined functions

In the following the sizes of these objects are given. The sizes differ
slightly between 32-bit and 64-bit systems because 32-bit systems use 4-byte
pointers and 64-bit systems use 8 byte pointers. In addition to the indicated
sizes there is a (very) small overhead in the malloc() library for every object.
Each of the objects is far bigger than its malloc overhead and therefore the
overhead can normally be ignored. A typical APL program is assumed to have
less than 1000 APL symbols (i.e. variables or defined functions) and an )SI
stack depth of less than 100. A typical computer on which GNU APL runs is
assumed to have 4 GB of memory available to the interpreter and it should
definitely have at least 1 GB.

.Sizes of Dynamic Objects
[options="header"]
[width="60%"]
|===============
| Object              | 32-bit system | 64-bit system
| ValueStackItem      | 16            | 24
| Token               | 20            | 24
| Ravel Cell          | 20            | 24
| UCS_string          | 20 + X        | 24 + X
| APL Symbol          | 56 + X        | 80 + X
| Defined Function    | 292 + X       | 400 + X
| Call Stack Entry    | 2952          | 3952
| APL Value           | 372 + X       | 456 + X
|===============

In the table above, the term + X means that the object is a structure that
contains other objects. For example the size of a defined function depends
on the number of function lines and their lengths. Likewise, the size of an
APL value depends primarily on the number of its ravel elements. The term X
for the different objects is explained in the following.

=== X for a Unicode string (aka. UCS string)

X is 4 byte per Unicode character. For performance reasons at least 16
characters are being allocated so that X ≥ 64.

=== X for an APL Symbol

An APL symbol has two variable parts: an UCS string containing the name of the
symbol (e.g. a variable name or a the name of a defined function) and value
stack. The value stack of a function is initially empty, but is increased
when a defined function is called and the symbol is a local variable or a
label in the defined function and decreased if that function returns. The
amount of memory by which the stack is increased is the size of a
*ValueStackItem* in the table above.

=== X for a Defined Function

When a defined functions is created, then its textual representation (i.e.
the argument for ⎕FX or the result produced by the ∇-editor). This textual
representation is stored in the function object for the purpose of displaying
error information in case the execution of the function fails.

The textual representation is then converted into an internal representation
of fixed-sized Token with one token for each lexical unit. A Lexical unit is:

* one user-defined name, or
* one distinguished name, or
* one primitive function, or
* a special symbol (◊ [ ] etc.)

Finally a jump table to the different function lines is added to the
function. The X for the function is therefore Utx + N×To + L×Jt, where

* Utx is the size of UCS_string containing the function text,
* N is the number of Token,
* To is the size of a Token as above,
* L is the number of function lines
* Jt is the size of a jump table entry (4 bytes)

=== X for an APL Value

GNU APL distinguishes between short values and long values. A short value is a
value with up to 12 ravel elements while a long value is a value with more
than 12 ravel elements. The split point between long and short values is 12 by
default, but can be changed via ./configure.

The rationale for distinguishing short and long values is performance. A short
value can be allocated in a single new() call while a long value needs two
new() calls: one for the value header (which contains the shape of the value),
and one for the ravel cells of the value. Looking at the details of malloc()
one can see that the allocation or de-allocation of smaller memory areas is more
efficient than the allocation or de-allocation of larger areas, Finally,
short APL values occur more frequent in APL programs than long values, and they
are also more frequently overridden as a whole (which allocates a new value
and discards the old) as opposed to being updated via indexed assignment
(which changes an existing value but does does not create a newly allocated
value (unless nesting is involved)).

* If a value is short then X = 0
* otherwise X = N × Ce, where
** N is the number of ravel elements (i.e. ⍴,VALUE), and
** Ce is the size of a ravel Cell as above.

*Note:* In the classical APL world of ISO 8485, all ravel elements of an APL
value had the same type like bit, 8-bit char, 32-bit integer, or float and the
ravel was densely packet. Accessing a particular element V[n] of a value V was
a fast constant time operation, which was internally performed very
frequently. Many APL primitive functions (with the noteworthy exception of
scalar functions) need to perform multiple computations of V[n] for one
of their arguments V.

In ISO 13751 the concept of mixed values was introduced, In a mixed value
different ravel elements can have different types, so that the type becomes a
property of each ravel element of a value instead of a property of the value
itself. The implementer of ISO 13751 then had different alternatives (and
possibly combinations of them) to deal with mixed values:

* Leave the existing bit-, byte-, integer- and float-arrays as they
  are and add a new kind of mixed-arrays. This was a reasonable approach for
  those who had a code base from ISO 8485 already and who wanted to extend
  that code base to ISO 13751.

* Make the ravel elements pointers to a different location that contains the
  real ravel elements. Since all pointers have the same size, the constant time
  access to arbitrary ravel elements would remain. The performance cost
  would be somewhat higher due to:
** the additional indirection via the pointers, and
** possibly one more memory allocation per ravel element.
  While the cost for the additional indirection would probably be more than
  compensated by the reduced access time, the cost for additional memory
  allocations could have become a major headache.

* Make the ravel elements virtual objects that all have the same size. That
  means instead of primitive functions working with pointers to ravel
  elements, the ravel elements would point to the functions that are
  appropriate for their type. On one hand this approach wastes quite some
  memory because the largest possible type (i.e. complex numbers) determines
  the size of all ravel cells including those that would fit in far fewer
  bytes. On the other hand there are quite a few advantages:
** The the same size of all elements causes V[n] to take constant time,
** The indexed assignment of e.g. a single element (of a different type) to a
   non-mixed array would also take (constant time (in option 1 above the entire
   array would have needed to be converted from non-mixed to mixed)).
** The number of different array types would be reduced to 1 instead of being
   increased from 5 to 6 (bit, byte, integer, float, complex, and mixed). This
   in turn makes a huge number of type-checks in the dyadic APL primitives
   obsolete. Since a virtual cell knows its own type, it only needs to check
   the type of the other cell(s) in a dyadic operation.
** The "wasted" space could be used for other features at no extra cost such as:
*** 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit Integers,
*** rational number arithmetic for floating point numbers

Since GNU APL was to be designed from scratch without having a  prior code base,
the first option was ruled out almost immediately. The second option was
briefly considered, but then ruled out as well because code size for the
second option was expected to be significantly larger than for the third
option.

== Summary

The discussion of sizes so far can be summarized as:

*Corollary:* For a typical APL program on a typical computer, the only items
of concern in the context of memory management are APL values.

*Note:* The default values of system variable ⎕SYL (aka. system limits)
guarantee to some extent that an APL program behaves like a typical APL
program,

== How the Available Memory is Estimated

=== History

In the good old days of CP/M and friends, say 1975, memory management was
rather simple. The process running an APL interpreter would know how much
memory was reserved (and therefore available for it) and it could use that
memory without restrictions. The amount of memory (say *initial-⎕WA*) that
the process could use was simply:

* *initial-⎕WA = top-of-memory - top-of-used-memory*

This value was determined at the start-up of the interpreter (where the mallow()
pool was essentially empty) and the interpreter would keep track of the memory
that it allocated after that, say *memory-used*. So printing ⎕WA at any time
would essentially show *initial-⎕WA - memory-used*. And that was it.

=== Present memory management

Since then a number of things have changed. The changes are in general
advantageous, but also cause trouble in very specific situations. The main
differences, as seen by an application like GNU APL are:

* Change from physical to virtual memory. These days the memory allocated by
  malloc() is virtual. Under *normal* circumstances the application need not
  care about this difference, but in some special cases it is negatively
  affected (and can then do very little about it).

* A direct consequence of virtual memory is that the size of it is no longer
  determined by the physical memory available in a computer, but by other
  properties like the number of bits in the virtual memory addresses. This
  makes it impossible to determine initial-⎕WA (more precisely: ⎕WA is no
  longer a constant but becomes dependent of what happens not only in the APL
  interpreter itself but also in other processes and/or in the kernel.

* Over-commitment: Modern operating systems return far more virtual memory to
  applications than they really have in terms of physical memory. The idea is
  that not all applications reach their maximum need for memory a the same
  time, so that the same piece of physical memory can be used by different
  applications (or by the kernel for that matter) at different times.

*Corollary 1:* In the old days, the memory that an applications has obtained
from the kernel was a *guarantee*. These day it is merely a *promise* which
*normally* kept but may fail with a small though non-zero probability.

*Corollary 2:* As far as GNU APL is concerned, GNU APL does not (and actually
cannot) guarantee proper operation if the kernel reaches the limit of its
physical memory. Some error handling mechanisms, in particular WS FULL errors,
may fail in a non-graceful fashion - including immediate termination of the
GNU APL process without any warnings.

Although a crash of GNU APL cannot be prevented in general. one can decrease
the probability of such crashes by taking counter-measures beforehand. Most GNU
APL users will not need this (see *normal* above), but those facing problems
with improper WS FULL handling should read on.

== Improving the GNU APL WS FULL handling

=== The OOM handler

One enemy of GNU APL is the kernel's OOM (out-of-memory) handler. The OOM
handler is invoked when the kernel needs (physical) memory and has none. It
then kills one or more running processes in order to claim their memory back.
The processes that are killed (un-gracefully) may or may not be the process(es)
that have caused the shortage of memory. That is:

* GNU APL may be killed by some other (unrelated) process or interrupt that
  has requested memory, or
* some other (unrelated) process may be killed by a memory request from GNU
  APL, or
* GNU APL is killed by a memory request from itself.

It should be clear that the first two cases are very difficult to reproduce.
The third case is much easier by creating a very large APL value. It is also
the case that has been observed in reality.

In GNU/Linux one can protect individual processes from being killed by the
OOM handler with the following command (as root; <PID> is the process ID of
the process to be protected:

----
echo -17 > /proc/<PID>/oom_adj
----

The OOM handler can also be disabled entirely with

----
sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=2
----

or:

----
echo "vm.overcommit_memory=2" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
----

*Warning:* These settings can seriously impact the stability of the operating
system and should not be used on machines whose availability is a concern.
There is no point in sacrificing the stability of a system for the stability of
a process running on that system.

=== Using System Limits

Instead of disabling the OOM handler, one should use methods that prevent GNU
APL from requesting too much memory. so that the OOM handler is not invoked
in the first place (at least not from GNU APL). There are several ⎕SYL (aka.
system limit) entries that can be set by an APL program in order to prevent
GNU APL from requesting too much memory. Some of them have to be combined
with other to achieve full protection.

* ⎕SYL[1;] limits the depth of the )SI stack and therefore the amount of
  memory spent for function calls. Referring to Table 2 above, *⎕SYL[1;2]←1000*
  will throw a LIMIT ERROR if the )SI stack grows above 3 Megabytes (32-bit
  systems) or 4 Megabytes (64-bit systems).
* ⎕SYL[2;] limits the number of APL values. *⎕SYL[2;2]←1000* will throw a
  LIMIT ERROR when more than 1000 APL values (variables as well as
  intermediate results) are created. Referring to Table 2 above, this
  corresponds to 372 kByte on 32-bit systems, or 456 kByte on 64-bit systems.
  Note that the space for localized variables of defined functions belongs to
  ⎕SYL[2;] and not to ⎕SYL[1;].
* ⎕SYL[3;] limits the number of ravel elements in APL values.
  *⎕SYL[3;2]←1000000* will throw a LIMIT ERROR before more than 20 MByte on
  32-bit systems, or more than 24 MByte on 64-bit systems is requested.
* Finally, ⎕SYL[31 32;] define a safety margin that is is explained below.

In short, ⎕SYL[1;] protects primarily against too deep recursion, which is most
likely caused by a programming fault. ⎕SYL[2;] protects against too many APL
values, and ⎕SYL[2;] protects against too large APL values.

Like WS FULL and other APL errors, hitting a system limit brings the
interpreter back to immediate execution (interactive) mode. If one wants to
handle the situation programmatically, one can catch the limit error with ⎕EA,
⎕EB, or ⎕EC.


=== Analyzing /proc/meminfo

On a GNU/Linux machine, the file */proc/meminfo* provides quite useful
information about the usage of memory at the point in time when /proc/meminfo
is read. Before setting system limits as described above, one should consult
/proc/meminfo to see how the memory is distributed and then set the limits
accordingly.

Ideally */proc/meminfo* shows something like:

----
MemTotal:         185736 kB
MemFree:           12660 kB
MemAvailable:     126264 kB
Buffers:           74704 kB
Cached:            54732 kB
----

In that case *MemAvailable:* is the value on which the system limits settings
should be based. On older GNU/Linux machines *MemAvailable:* may not be
displayed. In that case *MemFree: + Cached:* can be used as a work-around.

The actual implementation of *MemAvailable:* by the kernel is quite complex
(more than simply adding *MemFree:* and *Cached:*). For that reason, even if
*MemAvailable:* were available on all GNU/Linux machines it would still
be impossible to call it before each creation of an APL value.

Instead, GNU APL uses the following simple algorithm:

* After the interpreter has started, compute *total_memory* as follows:
** If the process that runs the interpreter has a limit set on the amount of
   its virtual memory, then the interpreter assumes that that amount of memory
   will be available and sets *total_memory* to that limit. In this case
   */proc/meminfo* is not used.
** Otherwise (i.e. the virtual memory for the process is unlimited) the
   interpreter consults */proc/meminfo* and sets *total_memory* to either
   *MemAvailable:* (if present) or else to *MemFree: + Cached:*.
* As new APL values are created and destroyed in the course of running APL
  programs, the amount of memory allocated for them is tracked in, say,
  *used_memory*.
* Before requesting new memory of, say, size *new*, GNU APL checks that
----
   total_memory_1 ≥ used_memory + new + ⎕WA-margin
----
* In this check *total_memory_1* is *⎕SYL[32;2]* percent of *total_memory*
  above, and reduced by *⎕SYL[31;2]*. The reason for the scaling by
  *⎕SYL[32;2]* is that malloc() usually requests slightly more memory from
  the kernel than the application had requested from malloc().

** If that check fails then WS FULL is raised,
** otherwise the request is forwarded to malloc() and from there possibly
   to the kernel.

The ⎕WA-margin currently has a default value of 0, but can be changed via 

=== Hints for GNU APL Users

==== Setting a memory limit

If stability of a system is a concern, then setting memory limits for
processes is normally a good idea. The command for doing that is differs
between shells; in *bash* you can start GNU APL with a virtual memory limit
of like this:
----
ulimit -v 1000000
apl
----
The unis is kB, so that the command above will set the limit to 1 GB. The
limit remains in force for all subsequent commands and can be removed like
this:

----
ulimit -v unlimited
apl
----

*Note:* setting memory limits via *ulimit* as such does not directly solve the
problem that a process may have when it reaches the limit. However, it
helps a procxss in predicting when the limit will be reached.

=== 32-bit GNU/Linux

On 32-bit machines there is a per process memory limit of about 3 GByte. If
the memory of a machines is, say, 8 GB or more then one can have several
processes with each process allocating up to 3 GByte as long as the memory
shown in */proc/meminfo* is not exceeded.

If GNU APL sees a *total_memory* of more than 3 GB in the analysis of
*/proc/meminfo*, then it reduces *total_memory* to about 3 GB. if it is
running on a 32-bit kernel. 64-bit machines have a similar limit, but the
limit is so high that is is not relevant in practice.

The safety margin *(total_memory_1* - *total_memory)* that results from
*⎕SYL[31 32;2]* remains in effect so that the total memory that an APL program
can obtain is somewhere below 3 GB.

==== Troubleshooting WS FULL problems

For debugging purposes the safety margin can be disabled in APL like this:

----
      ⎕SYL[31;2] ← 1000000         ⍝ smallest margin (1 MB)
      ⎕SYL[32;2] ← 200             ⍝ far above available
----

WS FULL can occur in very many places of the interpreter. To find the exact
position where a WS FULL was generated, some related logging facilities can be
turned on:

----
      ]log 25
      ]log 26
      ]log 45
----

On a 32-bit machine A WS FULL can be reliably produced like this (the example
was kindly provided by Christian Robert):

----
      N←5000000    ⍝ 32-bit; use a larger value for 64-bit
      A←⊂'0123456789ABCDEF
      ↑↑ N ⍴ A      ⍝ trigger WS FULL
----

This example is of particular interest because, depending upon variable *N*
it creates two different challenges for the kernel. One is a big allocation
when the process is already near starvation and one is a small allocation
that fails.

in both cases the WS FULL is caused by *N ⍴ A*. Because A is a scalar (due to
⊂), all ravel elements of the result are nested values. Therefore  the
computation of *N ⍴ A* creates exactly 1+N values: a big value for the result
itself and N small nested values the the ravel of the result.

Referring to Table 2, the variable *A* (and therefore each nested value of the
result needs *372 + 16*20 = 692* bytes. The top-level of the result requires
*372 + N*20* bytes. Let *F* be the amount of (free) memory that could be
obtained from malloc(). Then:

1. if *F < 372 + N*20* then the allocation of the top-level value fails,

2. else if *F < 372 + N*20 + N*692* then the allocation of the top-level value
  succeeds, but the allocation of one of the nested sub-values fails,

3. else all allocations succeed and *N ⍴ A* succeeds as expected.

The less than obvious difference between the first and the second case is the
amount of free memory at the point in time where the allocation failed:

1. if the first (big) allocation fails, then the free memory is still F,

2. if one of the subsequent (small) allocations fail then (since the previous
   allocations have succeeded) the free memory is now less that the requested
   size, regardless how large F was initially. In our example F would be less
   than 692 bytes (in theory) or less than about 1024 (in practice because
   malloc allocates the next power of 2).

Exception handling with only 1024 bytes left can fail as can be demonstrate on a
32-bit machine quite easily. The following examples show both cases (with
safety margin disabled in order to allow near-memory-starvation.

==== Differences between Example 1 and Example 2

* Execution time: the second example uses noticeably more time before the WS
  FULL occurs. In this time the interpreter creates a large number of
  sub-values until the memory is exhausted.
* The stack dumps differ. The pretty-printing of C++ function names requires
  extra memory, In example 2 that extra memory is not available so that
  backtrace_symbols() fails (and the interpreter then uses a function that
needs less memory):
----
 ----------------------------------------
 -- Stack trace at Error.cc:184
 ----------------------------------------
backtrace_symbols() failed. Using backtrace_symbols_fd() instead...

----

* The WS FULL is thrown from different locations. PrimitiveFunction.cc:230 is
  in the implementation of dyadic ⍴, while Value.cc:233 is the exception
  handler for *std::bad_alloc* (see also *what:* in the debug printout),

throwing WS FULL at Value.cc:233

* The )MORE information's in the two examples differ.  The term *Ravel
  allocation* in the printout of example 1 refers to the allocation of the
(big) top-level ravel.

=== Final Remarks

The exact behavior of processes with too little memory is generally difficult
to predict. While the A⍴N example given above is understood to some extent,
there are other cases such as out-of-memory when the process stack is
exhausted that were not yet reported.

We are trying our best to fix such cases, but when reporting them as errors
on bug-apl please consider the following.

* It helps a lot if you can provide reliable way to reproduce the problem.
  Most of the time for fixing an error is spent on reproducing it.
* Check that the problem cannot be fixed by setting memory limits. As explained
  above there are some boundary conditions from the operating systems that
  cannot be fixed (or even properly handled) by a process. Remember the
  existing tools for that:
** ulimit to protect processes from each other,
** ⎕SYL[1 2 3;2] to limit what the GNU APL interpreter may try allocate, and
** ⎕SYL[31 32;2] to avoid near-memory-starvation situations in the WS FULL
   exception handling

Thanks for using GNU APL.
