#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PATH_LIB_PCRE []
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   check for pcre lib and set PCRE_LIBS and PCRE_CFLAGS accordingly.
#
#   also provide --with-pcre option that may point to the $prefix of the
#   pcre installation - the macro will check $pcre/include and $pcre/lib to
#   contain the necessary files.
#
#   the usual two ACTION-IF-FOUND / ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND are NOT supported and
#   they can NOT take advantage of the LIBS/CFLAGS additions.
