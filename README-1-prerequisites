Before you can build GNU APL, make sure that the following
libraries/packages have been installed:

gcc/g++		from a GNU mirror (directory: gcc, file: gcc-?.?.?.tar.gz)
make		from a GNU mirror (directory: gcc, file: make-?.?.tar.gz)

If you are using Ubuntu, then the following commands may do the trick:

    apt-get install g++

For Fedora:

    dnf -y group install  "C Development Tools and Libraries" 

For Centos replace dnf by yum 

On Linux Mint 14.1, GNU APL compiled out-of--the-box.
On Fedora 25, GNU APL compiled out-of-the-box.
