Before you can build GNU APL, make sure that the following
libraries/packages have been installed:

(lib-)lapack    from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
(lib-)readline  from a GNU mirror (directory: bash, file: readline-?.?.tar.gz)
gettext         from a GNU mirror (directory: gettext)

gettext in only needed if you want an internationalized GNU APL. You
can ./configure it away with --disable-nls.

If you are using Ubuntu, then the following commands may do the trick:

apt-get install liblapack-dev
apt-get install libreadline5-dev
apt-get install gettext

readline and/or gettext are used by many other packages, so they may already
be installed on your GNU/Linux system.

On Linux Mint 16 (and possibly some other GNU/Linux distributions) you may
need to install package ncurses-dev in order to uses curses functions,
for example:

apt-get install ncurses-dev

On Linux Mint 14.1, GNU APL compiled out-of--the-box.
