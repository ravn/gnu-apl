1 Installing and Starting GNU APL
*********************************

1.1 Installing APL
==================

APL is built and installed like this:

   • download the tar file containing GNU APL, from
     <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/apl> or from one of its mirrors (see
     <http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html>), and un-tar the file.

   • read (and follow) the instructions given in file README in the
     unpacked directory

   For the experienced, but impatient reader: it is the usual sequence

   • ./configure

   • make

   • make install

   On success, an executable file called ’apl’ will have been produced
in the sub-directory ’src’.

   File README contains further instructions about the installation GNU
APL.

1.2 Starting APL
================

Last things first: before explaining how to start APL, it is important
to remember how to stop (i.e.  exit) it.  Neither ^C nor ^D will stop
APL - they serve other purposes.  Instead, you leave APL with the
command )OFF (on a separate line) like this:

   )OFF

   If APL is computing a function (and possibly caught in an endless
loop), then you may have to press ^C (called ATTENTION in APL) in order
to return to APL’s command mode and then give the )OFF command.

   Having that said, APL is started like every other program - entering
its name and optional command line parameters, for example:

   $ apl

   or:

   $ apl —id 1001

   GNU APL is script-able; a text file whose first line looks like this
(assuming the APL interpreter binary is called ’apl’ and is located in
the current directory):

   #!  apl

   or (if the APL interpreter binary is not in the current directory but
in /mypath/apl):

   #!  /mypath/apl

   The path to the ’apl’ binary can be missing (like in the first
example), relative, or absolute (second example).  The exact details of
how the first line of a GNU APL script shall look like varies slightly
among operating systems.  Please consult the info (or man) pages for
’path_resolution’ and/or ’execve’ on your operating system.  After the
the name of the binary, optional GNU APL command line options, usually
–script, can be provided.

   The text file must, of course, have execute permission, and should be
ASCII or, more likely, UTF-8 encoded.  The APL characters in the script
shall be those defined in the Unicode character set (most of them in the
U+2200 - U+23FF range).

1.3 Command Line Options
========================

GNU APL understands the following command line options:

   • ‘-C new_root’

     perform chroot("new_root") followed by chdir("/").  This restricts
     the access of the the process running GNU APL to files in or below
     directory new_root, and it also changes the current directory
     (which could have resided above new_root before the chroot() was
     executed).

     The -C option is intended to be a security feature for GNU APL
     interpreters that are facing a hostile environment like the public
     internet.

     NOTES:

        • For -C to work, new_root needs to contain minimal set of
          binaries, in particular a shell, and possibly libraries needed
          by the shell.  Consult ’info chroot invocation’ for issues to
          consider and common pitfalls.

        • GNU APL processes the -C option (i.e.  it calls
          chroot("new_root")) before all other command line options.  As
          a consequence, file names in other command line options of GNU
          APL are also affected by -C. That means that the file names in
          command line options arr being interpreted relative to
          new_root and not relative to the current directory of the
          process that had started GNU APL.

        • GNU APL may automatically start other processes such as
          APserver and friends after processing the -C option.  These
          processes (and the libraries that they depend on) should
          reside in the proper directory below new_root.  For example,
          with the default configuration of GNU APL, GNU APL installs
          itself in /usr/local/bin and also expects APserver in the same
          directory.  After -C new_root.  however, /usr/local/bin is no
          longer accessible and one would need to copy
          /usr/local/bin/APserver to new_root/usr/local/bin/APserver

        • Depending on your platform, the process using -C may need root
          privileges.

   • ‘--cfg’

     show ./configure options that were used to configure GNU APL, and
     exit.

   • ‘--[no]Color’

     start with ]COLOR ON [OFF].

   • ‘-d’

     run the APL interpreter (or APL script) in the background (i.e.  as
     a daemon).  For this to work you need to provide some input to the
     background process, e.g.  via the -f option.

   • ‘--emacs’

     run in (old) Emacs mode.

   • ‘--emacs_arg arg’

     run in (new) Emacs mode with argument arg.

   • ‘--eval line’

     evaluate one APL line and exit.  This option can be given several
     times; in that case several lines are being executed before GNU apl
     exits.  Keep in mind that command line options are normally
     processed by your shell before being passed to apl.  Therefore
     sometimes quoting the argument of –eval may be needed and common
     wisdom has it to always quote the argument of –eval.

   • ‘-f file’

     read input from file rather than from the keyboard.  When the end
     of the file is reached, input is switched back to the keyboard.  If
     you want to terminate the APL interpreter after executing the file,
     then use )OFF as last line in the file.

   • ‘--gpl’

     show GNU APL license (GPL) and exit.

   • ‘-L wsname’

     )LOAD wsname on start-up.

   • ‘--LX expr’

     execute expr first.  The workspaces behaves as if ⎕LX (latent
     expression) were set to expr in the workspace.  This can be used,
     for example, to start the same workspace with different start-up
     values.

   • ‘-h’, ‘--help’

     print all command line options with a brief hint what they do.

   • ‘--id proc’

     use processor ID proc for this interpreter.  If no ID is provided,
     then the first unused ID > 1000 is taken by this interpreter and
     the ID becomes used as long as the interpreter runs.  Processor IDs
     are used by shared variables to identify share partners.

   • ‘-l num’

     turn logging facility num ON (provided that dynamic logging was
     ./configure’d).  The logging facility 37 (start-up messages) is of
     particular importance for troubleshooting and it works even if
     dynamic logging was not ./configure’d.

   • ‘--mem [memory-limit]’

     tell the interpreter to not use more than memory-limit bytes of
     RAM. By using this option, the user is fully responsible for
     ensuring that the specified amount of memory will always be
     available.  The following rules should be observed.

     The interpreter will exit at start-up if ‘--mem’ is used and:

        • the platform on which the interpreter runs has no
          /proc/meminfo, or
        • the platform has no /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory, or
        • /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is not 2 (aka.  ’never
          overcommit’)

     On GNU/Linux systems these conditions are normally satisfied, but
     the root user has to set /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory to 2 which
     differs from the default value 0 (aka.  overcommit allowed).

     If no memory-limit is given, then a memory-limit of 50% is used.

     If a memory-limit is provided then it must have a unit of %, kB,
     MB, or GB. If the unit is % then the limit is computed as that
     percentage (between 5% and 95%) of parameter ’MemFree:’ in
     /proc/meminfo.  Otherwise the limit is the given amount in kB, MB,
     or GB.

     For example:

        • ‘--mem’ (50% of MemFree: in /proc/meminfo are guaranteed)
        • ‘--mem 80%’ (80% of MemFree: in /proc/meminfo are guaranteed)
        • ‘--mem 5G’ (5 GB are guaranteed)

     WARNING: The memory-limit is checked against parameter ’MemFree’ in
     /proc/meminfo when GNU APL starts, but this does not protect
     against other processes consuming the free memory at a later point
     in time.

     If that happens (and according to the rules above the user has the
     responsibility to prevent it), then ⎕WA becomes unreliable and the
     interpreter may crash badly (i.e.  without a WS FULL error, and
     without any chance to )SAVE the workspace) when the available
     memory is exhausted.

   • ‘--echoCIN’ copy the input line (after editing) to stdout.  For
     creating session logs.

   • ‘--noCIN’

     do not echo stdin to stdout.  Almost a must for scripting (unless
     you troubleshoot a script).

   • ‘--to_COUT’

     normally GNU APL writes its output to stderr (i.e.  file descriptor
     2) so that, when GNU APL is started in a script, the output of the
     script appears on stdout (i.e.  file descriptor 1) while the output
     of GNU APL appears on stderr.

     This option redirects the stderr output of GNU APL to stdout.  The
     same effect can be achieved with the option "OUTPUT-TO-COUT Yes" in
     a preferences file.

   • ‘--tcp_port PORT’

     this option starts GNU APL as server that listens on TCP port PORT.
     Every TCP connection accepted by the server forks a new GNU APL
     instance which has its stdin, stdout, and stderr redirected to the
     TCP connection.

     WARNING: This option is dangerous if PORT is directly exposed to
     the internet!

   • ‘--noCONT’

     do not load a SETUP or CONTINUE workspace on start-up.

   • ‘--OFF’

     This option causes GNU APL to perform an automatic )OFF command
     after the last line of the last input file (as per -f option) was
     executed.

   • ‘--PW COLS’

     set the initial value of ⎕PW to COLS (min.  30, max.  10000)

   • ‘--[no]SV’

     do [not] start APserver (a shared variable server) on start-up.
     This disables communication with other workspaces or auxiliary
     processors through shared variables.

   • ‘-p N’

     use profile number N in preferences files.

   • ‘--par pproc’

     use processor parent ID pproc (default: no parent ID).

   • ‘--rawCIN’

     do not emit ESC sequences.  Normally ESC sequences are emitted for
     colored output and during line editing.  In scripts, however, ESC
     sequences usually not wanted and can be turned off with this
     option.

   • ‘-s’, ‘--script’

     this option is an abbreviation for: ‘--silent’ ‘--noCIN’ ‘--noCONT’
     ‘-f -’ which is a typical combination of options for APL scripts.

   • ‘-q’, ‘--silent’

     suppress printing of the GNU APL welcome message.  Useful for
     scripts.

   • ‘--safe’

     disable shared variables and native functions

   • ‘--show_bin_dir’

     display the binary directory (where, according to ./configure, the
     programs apl, APserver, AP100, and AP210 are supposed to be
     installed.  Then exit.

   • ‘--show_doc_dir’

     display the directory where, according to ./configure,
     documentation files for GNU APL are installed.  Then exit.

   • ‘--show_etc_dir’

     display the system configuration directory where, according to
     ./configure, the preferences file for GNU APL is installed.  Then
     exit.

   • ‘--show_lib_dir’

     display the library directory where, according to ./configure,
     shared library files and the workspaces shipped with GNU APL are
     installed.  Then exit.

   • ‘--show_src_dir’

     display the source directory where, according to ./configure, GNU
     APL was compiled.  Then exit.  This can be used, for example, by
     native functions that are built outside the GNU APL source tree to
     find GNU APL header files that are needed to compile the native
     function.

   • ‘--show_all_dirs’

     display all the directories above.  Then exit.

   • ‘-T testcases ...’ run testcases.  Testcases are text files that
     contain both input to the APL interpreter and the expected response
     from the interpreter.  The output from the interpreter is compared
     with the expected output in the testcase file(s) and differences
     are marked.  In addition a summary file is created that tells
     whether or not each of the testcases was successful.

   • 
     ‘--TM mode’

     test mode.  This option how the interpreter shall behave when
     running a number of testcases (as specified with the ‘-T’ option)

     ‘--TM 0’ (default) run all testcases and exit after the last
     testcase.

     ‘--TM 1’ like ‘--TM 0’ if no error was detected.  However, if one
     of the testcases has failed, then the interpreter does not exit so
     that the user can investigate the state of APL (SI, variable
     values, etc.).

     ‘--TM 2’ like ‘--TM 1’, but stay in the interpreter even if all
     testcases have passed.  This can be useful in order to quickly
     bring the interpreter into a specific state and continue manual
     troubleshooting from that state.

     ‘--TM 3’ like ‘--TM 1’, but stop testcase execution after the first
     failed testcase (i.e.  do not exit).

     ‘--TM 4’ like ‘--TM 3’, but exit after the first failed testcase.
     The is useful for automatic regression tests, where no errors are
     expected.

   • ‘--TR’

     executes test case files in random order.

   • ‘--TS’

     Normally, when the interpreter is run with the ‘-T’ option, then an
     existing summary.log file is overridden without notice.  This
     option causes new test results to be appended to a possibly
     existing summary.log instead of overriding it.

   • ‘-v’, ‘--version’,

     show version information and exit.

   • ‘-u UID’

     run as user with UID 0.  This option can only be used by the root
     user (who then wants to run as a different user).

   • ‘-w milli’

     wait milli milliseconds at start-up.  Useful to give other programs
     that are started together with this interpreter time to initialize
     themselves.

   • ‘--’

     end of command line options for the interpreter.  GNU APL provides
     the system variable ⎕ARG that returns all command line options with
     which the GNU APL interpreter was invoked (similar to variable argv
     in main(int argv, char * argv[]) in C/C++).  Option —- can be used
     to separate command line options for the APL interpreter from
     command line options understood by APL applications.

     Thus,

     ‘(⎕ARG ⍳ ⊂'--') ↑ ⎕ARG’ returns the options for the APL
     interpreter, while

     ‘(⎕ARG ⍳ ⊂'--') ↓ ⎕ARG’ returns the options for the APL
     application.

     All command line options after ‘--’ are ignored by the interpreter
     (except making them available in ⎕ARG).

1.4 Configuration File for GNU APL
==================================

The default values for some of the command line options discussed in the
previous section can be set in a configuration file for GNU APL. The
name of the configuration file is ’preferences’ and it should live in
one of the following directories:

   • in the sub-directory gnu-apl.d of the system configuration
     directory, or

   • in the sub-directory .config/gnu-apl of the user’s home directory
     (as per $HOME).

   The system configuration directory is usually /etc or /usr/local/etc
and is configurable via ‘./configure --sysconfdir’.  An empty (i.e.  all
settings commented out) preferences file is being installed in the
system configuration directory when GNU APL is installed.  You can edit
it or use it as a template to see which options can be controlled.

   If file ’preferences’ exists in both directories, then the settings
in $HOME/.gnu-apl/preferences override settings in, for example,
/etc/gnu-apl.d/preferences.

   Command line options in turn override settings in ’preferences’
files.

1.5 File Names and Paths
========================

The GNU APL interpreter is a binary file named apl.  It is usually
installed in directory /usr/bin/ or in /usr/local/bin/.  The location
where apl is installed can be changed via ./configure options (see file
INSTALL).

   GNU APL understands 4 file types:

  1. APL workspaces that can be manipulated with the )LOAD, )SAVE,
     )COPY, and )DROP commands.  APL workspaces are XML files and must
     have a file extension of .xml in order to be accepted by GNU APL.
     APL workspaces can only be exchanged between machines that all run
     GNU APL.

  2. APL exchange files can be manipulated with the )IN and )OUT
     commands.  APL exchange files are text files in ⎕TF format defined
     by IBM (basically APL expressions that create variables or
     functions) and must have a file extension of .atf in order to be
     accepted by GNU APL. APL exchange files can be exchanged between
     machines running APL interpreters from different vendors.  The ⎕TF
     format can be easily emulated on machines not providing compatible
     )IN and )OUT commands.

  3. APL scripts consist of APL commands and APL expressions (including
     function definition via ∇) like they would be entered by the user.
     APL scripts should have a file extension of .apl but other
     extensions are also accepted by GNU APL. APL scripts are, for
     example, the files expected for the -f command line option.  A
     workspace can be written in this format with the )DUMP command.

  4. APL testcase files are similar to APL scripts, but in addition to
     the APL commands and expression they also contain the expected
     output from from the commands APL testcase files normally have have
     a file extension of .tc for normal (functional) testcases and .pt
     for performance testcases.  APL testcase files are, for example,
     the files expected for the -T command line option.

   The following APL commands are related to file names:

   )LOAD [lib] name[.xml]

   )SAVE [lib] [name[.xml]]

   )COPY [lib] [name[.xml]]

   )PCOPY [lib] [name[.xml]]

   )DROP [lib] [name[.xml]]

   )IN [lib] name[.atf]

   )PIN [lib] name[.atf]

   )OUT [lib] name[.atf]

   )DUMP [lib] [name[.apl]]

   )LIB [lib]

   )LIBS [new-lib-root]

   )WSID [name]

   The rules how file names are constructed from the argument(s) of an
APL command are:

  1. command arguments shown in brackets are optional.

  2. lib is a number from 0 to 9.  If lib is not present then 0 is taken
     as default.

  3. if the name is optional and missing then the workspace ID (the name
     set with )WSID) is used.

  4. if the file extension (i.e.  .xml or .atf) is missing then it is
     appended automatically to name.

   If the name starts with ’/’ then it is taken as an absolute path to
the file (an absolute file name) and no further computation is done with
the name.

   Otherwise name is a relative path which is relative to some directory
library-root and a sub-directory of library-root that is determined by
the lib number.  The library numbers 0-9 correspond to the following
directories:

   0: library-root/workspaces/

   1: library-root/wslib1/

   2: library-root/wslib2/

   ...

   9: library-root/wslib9/

   The command )LIBS without arguments shows the mapping between library
numbers and paths.  The command )LIBS with an argument sets a new
lib-root.

   The command )LIB [lib] shows the files in library (i.e.  directory)
lib.

   The directory library-root is computed as follows when the
interpreter starts:

   If an environment variable APL_LIB_ROOT is defined, then its value is
used as library-root.  Otherwise the path from the current directory
(".")  up to the root directory ("/") is searched until a directory
containing two files ’workspaces’ and ’wslib1’ is found.  Normally
’workspaces’ and ’wslib1’ are directories, but for the computation of
library-root files suffice.

   If such a directory is found, then it is used as library-root;
otherwise the current directory (i.e.  ".")  is used and converted to an
absolute path.

   For example, if library-root is "."  then the command

   )LOAD 2 test

   will try to load the workspace file

   ./wslib2/test.xml

   Using a library root implies that all 10 library directories are
contained in the same directory.  This is good enough for single-user
environments but is often not adequate for multi-user environments where
some directories are not writable by users and different users have
different home directories.

   For that reason the above library root scheme can be overridden by
the GNU APL configuration files (preferences).  In these files you can
un-comment any of the LIBREF-0 to LIBREF-9 settings (which correspond to
library numbers 0 to 9) and provide your own paths.  The library numbers
NOT overridden in a ’preferences’ file still follow the library root
scheme.

File: apl.info,  Node: Section 2.1,  Next: Section 2.2,  Up: Chapter 2

2.1 APL Scripting
=================

As already mentioned, it is possible to write APL scripts.  Similar to
other script languages, an APL script is a text file whose first line is
a "shebang line", i.e.  a line starting with ‘#!’, followed by the
absolute path to the interpreter (in our case the GNU APL binary),
followed by command line arguments that are passed on to the
interpreter.  In our case the shebang line could be, for example:

    #! /usr/local/bin/apl --id 1010

   There are essentially two ways to run an APL script: redirecting the
script file to stdin of the interpreter or making the script executable
and indicate apl as the script interpreter (followed by some command
line arguments for apl).

2.1.1 redirect the script file the stdin of the GNU APL interpreter
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A file, say SCRIPT.apl, can be redirected to apl by redirection of the
shell:

    apl < SCRIPT.apl

   Alternatively, the command line option -f of apl can be used:

    apl -f SCRIPT.apl

   Both ways of redirecting the file are almost identical; in the first
case redirection was performed by the shell running apl, while in the
second case the redirecting of the file was performed by apl itself.

2.1.2 Make the script file executable
-------------------------------------

Alternatively the script can be made executable, mentioning apl as the
interpreter for the script (see also ‘'man 2 execve'’).  For this to
work, the first line of the script must have a special format

    #! /usr/local/bin/apl --script

   ‘--script’ prevents: printing of a welcome banner, echoing of stdin
to stdout, automatic loading of a )CONTINUE workspaces, and prevents
starting of a thread for shared variable communication.

   If the path to the interpreter is relative (which might be useful if
you do not know in advance where the APL interpreter will be installed)
then it must be in $PATH of the shell that runs the script.

2.1.3 How command line arguments are handled
--------------------------------------------

As we have seen, GNU APL can be started directly (by entering the name
of the GNU APL binary on the command line of a shell, or indirectly by
entering the name of a script that provides the name of the GNU APL
binary on the first line of the script.  In the latter case, the shell
uses function execve() to start APL, and one can provide additional
arguments that are passed on to APL. We briefly discuss both cases:

   0.  General Remark

   There is a convention in (not only) GNU APL, that the command line
options (and possibly an optional option argument) that occur left of --
are options directed to (and understood by) the APL interpreter while
the options right of -- are passed to the APL application (and their
exact format is then defined by the APL application).  All command line
options that were used to start APL can later be retrieved with the
system variable ⎕ARG in APL.

   Example 1: APL started directly

   We start APL with some command line options and display them with
⎕ARG. The command line options for the interpreter are –silent, –id, and
1010, while the options app1 and app2 are for the APL application:

$ apl --silent -l 37 -- app1 app2
    ⊃⎕ARG
apl     
--silent
-l      
37      
--      
app1    
app2    

   Example 2: APL started indirectly

   A script is is a text file file which as execute permissions.  The
first line of a script, commonly known as the shebang of the script, has
a special format which specifies how the subsequent lines of the script
file shall be processed, see man execve for details.

   A GNU APL script is then a script whose shebang indicates the apl
binary as the intepreter for the subsequent lines where those subsequent
lines are either APL commands or APL statements.  With some limitations,
executing such an APL script yields the same result as entering the
subsequent lines in immediate execution mode.

   When APL is started directly, then there is only one (possibly empty)
set of command lines options, which are processed by the shell and then
passed to the apl binary.

   Starting APL indirectly refers to executing an APL script.  In this
case there are two sets of command line options:

   • those passed to the script as command line arguments, and
   • those on the shebang line of the scripts

   When the APL script is started, possibly with command line arguments,
then the command line arguments entered by the user are combined with
the arguments on the shebang line of the script in a way that is
described in ’man 2 execve’.

   Assume the script file SCRIPT.apl contains this (the file is shipped
with GNU APL):

#! /usr/local/bin/apl --id 1010 --script

      ⊃⎕ARG      ⍝ show command line options
      )OFF      ⍝ leave the interpreter


   Assume further that the script is started like this:

$ ./SCRIPT.apl sarg1 sarg2

   Then the following output, which shows the order of command line
options as seen by ⎕ARG, is produced:

   ⊃⎕ARG
/usr/local/bin/apl
--script          
./SCRIPT.apl      
sarg1             
sarg2 

   This suggests that the options and option argments are constructed by
execve() (the function that is eventually responsible for processing
scripts in shells and other executables) in the following order:

   1.  Interpreter name (the first name in the shebang, here:
/usr/local/bin/apl)

   2.  Optional Interpreter arguments (here: —-script)

   3.  Script filename (here: ./SCRIPT.apl)

   4.  Script arguments (here: sarg1 sarg2)

   CAUTION: as discussed in ’man 2 execve’ the interpretation of the
optional interpreter arguments (2.  above) is system specific and
possibly not portable.  For that reason the optional interpreter
argument should not be missing (you can use —- to provide at least one
argument) and also not more than one argument.  On GNU/Linux systems the
following shebang lines of the script are understood:

/usr/local/bin/apl
/usr/local/bin/apl --
/usr/local/bin/apl -s
/usr/local/bin/apl --script
/usr/local/bin/apl -s --
/usr/local/bin/apl --script --

   The recommended form is: /usr/local/bin/apl --script.

   Note that -- and any options that follow it on the shebang line MAY
OR MAY NOT be occur in ⎕ARG (this depends on the platform used).  In
contrast, options that follow -- on the script command line WILL BE
shown since this is controlled by GNU APL and not by the platform.
There is normally no point in passing any application options on the
shebang line to APL because such parameters can more easily be provided
directly further down in the script.  However in cases where the script
has only application options it may be convenient to make -- the last
option of the shebang so that the user of the script need not specify it
manually.

   Using -- on the shebang line of the script file usually prevents
subsequent options on the shebang line from being interpreted as APL
options (and, more importantly, from causing unknown option errors when
GNU APL starts).  At least under GNU/Linux with bash the subsequent
options will be passed to the APL application via ⎕ARG.

   Depending on this exact behaviour cannot be recommended.  A cleaner
approach is to use options starting with - or -- only for the
interpreter options, and options starting with + for application
options.  This should work on all platforms because for strings, say,
APLOPT, ARG1, ARG2, ..., which contain no whitespace:

   • +APLOPT is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,
   • ++APLOPT ARG1 is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,
   • +++APLOPT ARG1 ARG2 is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,
   • ...

2.1.4 Helpful Features for Scripting
------------------------------------

GNU APL provides three system variables and functions that are
particularly useful for scripting:

   • ⎕ARG: access to the command line arguments given to the
     interpreter,
   • ⎕ENV: access to the environment variables of the process running
     the interpreter, and
   • ⎕INP: Here-Document-alike function for creating large text
     variables

2.1.4.1 ⎕ARG
............

The system variable ⎕ARG contains all command line arguments passed to
the interpreter.  In the initial example above this would be a nested
3-element vector:

    /usr/local/bin/apl --id 1010

2.1.4.2 ⎕ENV
............

There are usually at least two ways of passing parameters to a script:

   • as command line options, and/or
   • by means of environment variables

   Just like the system variable ⎕ARG makes the command line optios used
available to APL, does the system function ⎕ENV make the environment
variables available to APL. Since there normally exist far more
environment variables than command line options, ⎕ENV is a monadic
function whose argument is a filter for the name(s) of the variable(s)
to be retrieved.

   ⎕ENV B returns all environment variables whose name starts with B. If
⍴B is 0, like:

    ⎕ENV ''

   then all environment variables of the process running GNU APL are
returned.

   The result of ⎕ENV is a (possibly empty) N×2 matrix.  The first
column contains the the name(s) of the environment variable(s), while
the second column contains their value(s).  The name and the value are
both strings.

   The number N of environment variables returned by ⎕ENV obviously
depends on the number of environment variables whose name begins with
the prefix given in B; shorter prefixes B therefore result in higher
counts N. B is case sensitive; by convention the names of environment
variables are all uppercase.  Note the subtle difference between shell
variables and environment variables in shells like bash: ⎕ENV returns
only environment variables (which are set with command setenv in bash),
but not shell variables (which are set with command set in bash).  For a
shell variable to occur in ⎕ENV it must be exported into the environment
of the process before the GNU APL interpreter is started.

2.1.4.3 ⎕INP
............

If you need to create a longer static text, like the body of a web page,
then you would normally construct it in APL like this:

BODY ← ⊂ 'First line'
BODY ← BODY , ⊂ 'Second line'
BODY ← BODY , ⊂ 'Third line'
   ...

   The above is obviously not very handy for longer texts.  Instead you
may write the following in a GNU APL script:

BODY←⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP'
First line
Second line
Third line
   ...
END-OF-⎕INP

   This works like "Here documents" in bash.  The right argument of ⎕INP
is the end of text marker.

   ⎕INP also has a dyadic form where the left argument specifies an
escape sequence from text to APL and back to the text, similar to PHP
scripts.  For example:

Z←'<?apl' '?>' ⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP'
First line
Time is now: <?apl ⍕⎕TS ?>
Third line
...
END-OF-⎕INP

   This creates a mainly static text with a small dynamic plug-in
computed by APL:

      ⊃Z
First line                       
Time is now: 2022 8 4 15 15 2 177
Third line                       
...         

   It should be noted that, while ⎕INP simplifies the construction of
multi-line strings compared to standard APL, it has come to age and
these days an even simpler feature - Multi-line strings as described
below - is provided for the same purpose.  The monadic ⎕INP has
therefore become obsolete.

2.1.5 Double-quoted Strings
---------------------------

Standard APL literals (aka.  strings) such as ’Hello’ are single quoted.
As a matter of convenience, GNU APL also provides double-quoted strings
which differ from single quoted strings in two ways:

   • A standard single quoted APL is a vector if its length is ≠ 1 but a
     scalar if its length is = 1.  This is sometimes inconvenient and
     therefore double-quoted strings are more consistent in always being
     vectors regardless of their length.  In other words, ’A’ is a
     scalar while "A" is a vector.

   • doubly quoted strings understand the standard C escape sequences
     for control character, such as \n for ASCII line feed, \t for ASCII
     TAB etc.

2.1.6 Multi-Line Strings
------------------------

Another feature of GNU APL to simplify the creation of values that
contain longer texts are strings that span several lines.  One
consequence of how ⎕INP works is that the strings read by ⎕INP always
originate in stdin of the interpreter.  In immediate execution mode (and
therefore also in APL scripts) reading stdin returns either the next
lines entered by the user (in interactive APL sessions) or else the next
lines in the script file (in APL scripts).  Often, however, a programmer
wants to specify long strings inside a defined function and not e.g.  on
the top-level of an APL script.  That renders ⎕INP almost useless for
defined functions.

   In order to provide a better way for defining long strings inside
defined functions, multi-line strings were introduced.  They come in two
flavors: old-style and new-style.

2.1.6.1 Old-style Multi-Line Strings
....................................

Old-style multi-line strings were the first attempt to provide long
strings for defined functions.  These strings are not allowed in
immediate execution mode because could easily be entered by mistake (by
simply forgetting the terminating " or ’ of a string) and that would
have obscured the traditional behavior of immediate execution mode.

   An old-style multi-line string starts at the last " in a line of a
defined function that has line with an odd number of " characters.  It
continues over the subsequent function lines until the next ".  The
result is a nested APL value containing one nested string per line
involved.  This method of specifying a multi-line string was adopted
from the bash shell.  In immediate execution mode an old-style
multi-line string yields No string end found.

   For example:

∇Z←FOO
 Z←"ABC
 DEF
 GHIJK"
∇

4 ⎕CR FOO
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃┏→━━┓ ┏→━━━┓ ┏→━━━━━┓┃
┃┃ABC┃ ┃ DEF┃ ┃ GHIJK┃┃
┃┗━━━┛ ┗━━━━┛ ┗━━━━━━┛┃
┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   If the first string is empty then the nested value starts with an
empty string, but completely empty lines in the defined function are
being ignored:

∇Z←FOO
 Z←"
ABC
 DEF

  GHIJK"
∇

4 ⎕CR FOO
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃┏⊖┓ ┏→━━┓ ┏→━━━┓ ┏→━━━━━━┓┃
┃┃ ┃ ┃ABC┃ ┃ DEF┃ ┃  GHIJK┃┃
┃┗━┛ ┗━━━┛ ┗━━━━┛ ┗━━━━━━━┛┃
┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

2.1.6.2 New-style Multi-Line Strings
....................................

Even though the combination of ⎕INP for immediate execution and
multi-line strings for defined functions achieved the goal of specifying
large amounts of text in a simple manner, it was certainly neither
intuitive nor elegant to have different approaches for the different APL
modes.

   This was leading to the new-style multi-line strings.  They adopted
the triple quote (""") syntax know from e.g.  the Python language.  The
syntax of new-style multi-line strings is cleaner: empty lines are
handled more consistently and the string lines are completely separated
from the APL code lines.  More importantly, new-style multi-line strings
work alike in immediate execution mode, in scripts, and in defined
functions.  New-style strings are a little different and syntactically
stricter than their old-style companions:

   • the starting """ must be placed at the end of an APL code line,
     i.e.  there is no more mixing of APL code and string content on the
     same line.  An old-style string starts with APL code and ends with
     the first line of the string, while a new-style string starts with
     an APL code line and the string itself begins at the following
     line.

   • the ending """ must be placed at the end of a separate lines with
     only spaces allowed before the """ (to vertically align it with the
     leading """ if so desired).  In old-style strings the text up to
     the termination " is part of the string while in new-style strings
     it is not.

   • Neither the starting nor the ending line become nested strings of
     the result, and every line can be clearly identified as being
     either APL code or else string text.

   Example:
 4 ⎕CR """
ABC
 DEF

  GHIJK
       """
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃┏→━━┓ ┏→━━━┓ ┏⊖┓ ┏→━━━━━━┓┃
┃┃ABC┃ ┃ DEF┃ ┃ ┃ ┃  GHIJK┃┃
┃┗━━━┛ ┗━━━━┛ ┗━┛ ┗━━━━━━━┛┃
┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   When entering a new-style multi-line strings then the prompt is
prefixed by → to indicate that a Multi-Line String is being entered.

   ⎕INP and old-style strings will coexist for a while, but may
disappear at some point in time.

2.1.7 Script Example
--------------------

Note that the two different ways of running an APL script have an impact
on how ⎕ARG looks like.  If stdin is redirected then there is only one
(possibly empty) set of command line options.  Otherwise there are two
set of command line options: command line options for the apl
interpreter and command line options for the script.

   Consider the following simple script called SCRIPT.apl in directory
workspaces:

#! /usr/local/bin/apl --script

⊃⎕ARG    ⍝ show command line options
)OFF    ⍝ leave the interpreter

   If SCRIPT.apl is redirected to stdin of the APL interpreter:

 /usr/local/bin/apl --silent <  ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl

 or

 /usr/local/bin/apl --silent -f ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl

   then the first line ‘#! /usr/local/bin/apl --script’ of file
SCRIPT.apl is merely a comment (GNU APL accepts both the traditional APL
character ⍝ and the character # as start of a comment).  The ‘--script’
option is therefore ignored and the following mix of input and output is
shown on the screen.  The input from the script is indented by the usual
APL prompt of 6 blanks, while the output of the APL interpreter is not
indented.

      #! /usr/local/bin/apl --script
      
      ⎕ARG      ⍝ show command line options
      )OFF      ⍝ leave the interpreter



   If we run the same script directly:

../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl

   Then we get:


 /usr/local/bin/apl --script ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl 


   The ‘--script’ implies ‘--noCIN’ so that the input lines for the
interpreter are no longer echoed to the output.  That is most likely
what you want when writing a script.

   Also, the first line of the script is no longer ignored as a comment,
but controls the command line argument (and thus ⎕ARG) of the
interpreter.  The additional command line argument
‘../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl’ comes from function execve (see ’man 2
execve’).

   If we provide an argument, say SCRIPTARG, to SCRIPT.apl:

../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl SCRIPTARG

   then it shows up at the end of ⎕ARG:


 /usr/local/bin/apl --script ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl SCRIPTARG 


   A final note on scripting in GNU APL is that the ∇-editor works
slightly differently when it is used in a script.  If a user edits an
APL function interactively then an attempt to open an existing function
with a full header gives a DEFN ERROR:


      ∇Z←FOO B
[1] ∇
      
            ∇Z←FOO B
DEFN ERROR+
      ∇Z←FOO B
             ^
      )MORE
attempt to ∇-open existing function with new function header


   In contrast to a user who can react to the DEFN ERROR, a script
cannot detect this situation and would continue to push lines (which
were intended to be the body of the defined function) into the APL
interpreter.  That would most likely cause a fairly undesirable
behavior.  For example, if the lines of defined function start with line
numbers (like [1], [2], ...)  then every such line would give a SYNTAX
ERROR, and other errors can be expected as well.

   For that reason, if the ∇-editor is used in a script and attempts to
redefine an existing defined function then the existing function is
simply overridden with the new one and no DEFN ERROR is raised.

2.2 Axis argument in defined functions
======================================

Defined functions and operators (including lambdas) accept an axis
argument.  For example:


∇Z←Average[X] B
 Z←(+/[X]B) ÷ (⍴B)[X]
∇

      Average[1] 5 5⍴⍳25
11 12 13 14 15

      Average[2] 5 5⍴⍳25
3 8 13 18 23


   Syntactically, the axis is used in the same way as for primitive
functions and operators.

   There are no constraints on the axis such as being integers.
Therefore you can use an axis as a third function argument.  Keep in
mind, however, that doing so will make your APL code incompatible with
other APL interpreters.  Use this feature carefully!


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 2.3,  Next: Section 2.4,  Prev: Section 2.2,  Up: Chapter 2

2.3 Colored Output
==================

The APL interpreter gets its input from the standard input (stdin),
which is normally connected to the user’s keyboard, but can also be a
file if APL scripting, the ‘-f’ option, or the ‘-T’ option is used.

   The APL interpreter prints its results on either the standard output
(stdout) for normal APL output, or to the error output (stderr) for
additional trouble-shooting information.

   You can print the 3 channels stdin, stdout, and stderr in different
colors by means of the debug command ]XTERM. Command ]XTERM ON enables
colored output while ]XTERM OFF disables it (for example to avoid
annoying ANSI Escape sequences when forwarding stdout or stderr to a
file).

   By default colored output assumes a terminal (-emulation) that
understands ANSI (or VT100) Escape sequences.  The xterm that comes with
most recent GNU/Linux distributions is a perfect choice supporting both
colors and UTF-8 (Unicode) encoded character I/O.

   Non-ANSI terminals, as well as other colors than the default ones,
can be configured in the ’preferences’ file.  The ’preferences’ file
also contains a description of all possible color settings.


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 2.4,  Next: Section 2.5,  Prev: Section 2.3,  Up: Chapter 2

2.4 Comparison Rules
====================

Both IBM APL2 and the ISO standard require that the arguments of <, ≤,
≥, and > (but not of = or ≠) are integer or real numbers.  As a
consequence, the argument(s) of ⍋ or ⍒ (which require comparison) must
also a vector of integer or real numbers.

   In contrast, GNU APL also allows the comparison of characters and
numbers or the comparison of complex numbers according to the following,
more general, rules.

   Let A and B two APL values to be compared.  Then the final result of
comparing A and B is the first verdict (i.e.  either A < B, or A > B, or
A = B) obtained when following the rules below (and in that order):

  1. Comparison by rank: if (⍴⍴A) < (⍴⍴B) then A < B. And vice versa.

  2. Comparison by shape: if (⍴A) < (⍴B) then A < B. And vice versa.
     The first differing shape item (from the left) decides.

  3. Comparison of ravel elements: at this point (⍴A) ≡ (⍴B). If all
     corresponding ravel elements of A and B are equal (i.e.  tolerantly
     equal within ⎕CT as defined in the ISO standard) then A = B.

     Otherwise let A1 and B1 the first corresponding ravel elements of A
     and B with A1 ≠ B1.  If A1 < B1 then A < B and vice versa.  The
     comparison A1 < B1 is made according to the following rules 4.  -
     7.  below.

  4. Comparison by depth:

        • If A1 and B1 are both nested: the rules 1.  - 4.  above are
          (recursively) applied to corresponding ravel elements of ⊃A1
          and ⊃B1 until a verdict is obtained.

        • if A1 is simple and B1 is nested then A < B. And vice versa.

        • otherwise (i.e.  A1 and B1 are both simple): A < B if A1 < B1
          according to rules 5.  - 8.  below.  And vice versa.

  5. Comparison by Unicode: if A1 and B1 are both character values and
     (⎕UCS A1) < (⎕UCS B1) then A < B. And vice versa.

  6. Comparison by type: If A1 is a character and B1 is numeric, then A
     < B. And vice versa.

  7. Comparison by numeric value: if A1 and B1 are both numeric values
     then:

        • Comparison by real part: if (9○A1) < (9○B1) then A < B. And
          vice versa.

        • Comparison by imaginary part: otherwise if (11○A1) < (11○B1)
          then A < B. And vice versa.

  8. Otherwise: A = B.

   Another way of describing the rules above is that the comparison of
two values is comprised of sub-comparisons of certain properties of the
values in the following order:

   • the ranks of the values,
   • the shapes of the values,
   • the first differing ravel element (in row-major order) of the
     values,
   • the depths of the differing ravel elements,
   • the types (character vs.  numeric) of the differing ravel elements,
   • the Unicodes of the differing ravel elements (if applicable)
   • the real parts of numeric values,
   • the imaginary parts of numeric values,

   Note: Rules 1.  and 2.  above are only relevant for comparisons made
in the context of sorting (i.e.  for ⍋ or ⍒).  This is because for =, ≠,
<, ≤, ≥, or > either a RANK ERROR or a LENGTH ERROR is raised if the
ranks or shapes of A and B do not match:

      (9 8) < (1 2 3)
LENGTH ERROR
      9 8<1 2 3
      ^  ^

      ⍋(9 8) (1 2 3)
1 2

   The reason for comparing complex numbers first by their real parts
and then by their imaginary part and not, for example, first by their
magnitude and then by their angle is that the chosen order gives more
consistent results when comparing near-complex numbers or their true
real companions.  For example, a magnitude first comparison of complex
numbers would make ¯2 < ¯1 < ¯2J0E¯20 for the near-complex number
¯2J0E¯20.

   CAUTION: The comparison of two strings (i.e.  nested character
vectors) may give unexpected results because shorter strings come before
longer strings.  For example, ’Zoo’ comes before ’Adam’ even though one
might expect the opposite.

      Z[⍋Z ← 'Adam' 'Zoo']
 Zoo Adam 

      Z[⍋Z ← 'Adam' 'Zora']
 Adam Zora

   This pitfall can be avoided by enforcing the same length for all
strings being compared or sorted.  A simple way to achieve that is the
use of ⊂[2]⊃ like this (assuming IO←1):

      Z[⍋Z ← ⊂[2]⊃ 'Adam' 'Zoo']
 Adam Zoo  

      Z[⍋Z ← ⊂[2]⊃ 'Adam' 'Zora']
 Adam Zora

2.6 Debug Commands
==================

In addition to the classical APL commands like )LOAD or )SAVE, GNU APL
has a number of debug commands for debugging purposes.  Regular APL
commands start with ) and print their output on stdout.  Debug commands
start with ] and print their output on stderr.  Normally you cannot
easily distinguish between stdout and stderr, but another GNU APL
feature, colored output, uses different colors for stdout and stderr.

   Type )HELP or ]HELP in the interpreter for a list of all commands
available.

2.7 Direct Functions (Lambdas)
==============================

GNU APL supports direct functions (aka.  lambdas), but only in a rather
limited form.

2.7.1 Named Lambdas
-------------------

A statement of the form

      FUN ← { body_statement } 

   creates a named lambda.  body_statement can contain variable names ⍺
and ⍵ as well as function names ⍶ and ⍹ which are replaced by the actual
arguments of the lambda.  If both ⍺ and ⍵ are present in body_statement
then the lambda is dyadic.  If only ⍵ is present then it is monadic, and
if neither ⍺ nor ⍵ is present then the lambda is niladic.

   Likewise, if ⍶ and ⍹ are present then the lambda is a dyadic
operator.  If only ⍶ is present then it is a monadic operator, and if
neither ⍶ nor ⍹ is present then the lambda is a normal function.

   GNU APL supports an axis argument in normal user defined functions
and operators.  In lambda expressions the Greek letter χ (Chi) is the
variable name for an axis argument.

   The way a named lambda is implemented in GNU APL is that the
expression

      FUN ← { body_expression }

   is translated to a two-line function ⎕FX ’lambda_header’
’body_expression’.

   For example:

      )FNS

      SUM ← { ⍺ + ⍵ }

      )FNS
SUM

      ∇SUM[⎕]∇
[0] λ←⍺ SUM ⍵
[1] λ← ⍺ + ⍵ 


   The lambda_header is automatically deduced from the presence or
absence of the variable names (⍺, ⍵, and χ) and function names (⍶ and ⍹)
in the body_expression and from whether the body_expression is empty (no
λ←) or not (with λ←).

   It is possible to specify local variables that work exactly like
their companions in normal defined functions.  Please note that this is
different from some other APL interpreters which treat all variables in
lambda bodies as local variables.  The syntax for specifying local
variables is the same as for the header in normal defined functions:
they are added at the end with semicolons as separators.  In the above
example one could add local variables C and D like this:

      SUM ← { ⍺ + ⍵ ;C;D }

      ⎕CR 'SUM'
λ←⍺ λ1 ⍵;C;D 
λ← ⍺ + ⍵     


   If a named lambda is created inside a function, then the name of the
lambda (i.e.  the name left of ← { ...  }) can be made a local variable
of the function in which the named lambda is created.  This creates a
lambda with local scope.

   Please note that the above only describes the current implementation
of named lambda in GNU APL. A consequence of that implementation is that
the symbols ⍺, ⍵, ⍶, ⍹, and λ are pretty much behaving like user defined
variables.  In particular, they can be used outside named or unnamed
lambdas.  However, that may change in the future and therefore such use
of ⍺, ⍵, ⍶, ⍹, and λ outside is certainly a bad idea.

2.7.2 Unnamed Lambdas
---------------------

An unnamed lambda is an expression inside { } but without assigning it
to a name.  This is often used together with the EACH operator.  For
example:


      { ⍴ , ⍵ } ¨ 'a' 'ab' 'abc'
 1  2  3 


   Unnamed lambdas are automatically local in scope (similar to labels).
They can be passed as function arguments to operators.  However, unnamed
lambdas are NOT inserted into the symbol table of the interpreter.  They
are therefore not visible to functions like ⎕CR or by the ∇-editor.
Occasionally the names λ1, λ2, ...  may show up in commands like )SIS.
These names are automatically generated for unnamed lambdas in order to
provide a name in places where a function name is needed.

2.7.3 Limitations of Lambdas
----------------------------

There are a number of features related to lambdas that are present in
other APL interpreters but that are NOT implemented in GNU APL. This
includes multiple statements, guards, lexical scoping, and probably
more.

2.8 ]DOXY Command
=================

A particularly useful debug command is ]Doxy.  It dumps the current
workspace in brows-able HTML format with listings of defined functions
and hyperlinks between them.

     ]DOXY                   ⍝ write documentation to /tmp/WSNAME/*
     ]DOXY dest              ⍝ write documentation to dest/WSNAME/*

   The starting point for browsing the documentation are the files:

     /tmp/WSNAME/index.html         ⍝ for ]DOXY without arguments, resp.
     dest/WSNAME/index.html         ⍝ for e.g. ]DOXY dest

   The index.html files above usually corresponds to the following URIs
in your browser:

     file:///tmp/WSNAME   resp.
     file:///absolute-path-to-dest/WSNAME

   In the above examples is WSNAME the )WSID of the workspace in which
the ]DOXY command was executed.

   One can (and should make it a habit to) insert special comments into
defined function which are copied into proper places inside the
documentation that is generated by the ]DOXY command.  These "Doxy"
comments begin with ⍝⍝ (as opposed to "normal" APL comments that start
with a single ⍝.  Doxy comments are typically one-liners that briefly
explain what a function is supposed to do.

   For example:

∇Z←A SUM B
 ⍝⍝ Return the sum of A and B          ← ]DOXY comment:  (double ⍝)
 ⍝  A: numeric                         ← "normal" APL comments (single ⍝) ...
 ⍝  B: numeric
 Z←A + B

2.9 Commands )COPY_ONCE, )DUMP, and DUMP-HTML
=============================================

In standard APL, workspaces are processed with the standard commands
)LOAD, )COPY, and )SAVE. GNU APL provides additional commands to process
workspaces.

2.9.1 )DUMP Command
-------------------

GNU APL has a command )DUMP that saves a workspace to disk, similar to
command )OUT. The difference to command )OUT is the file format being
produced.  While )OUT produces a file in IBM’s workspace interchange
format (aka.  an .atf file), )DUMP produces a file in GNU APL’s script
format (i.e.  readable APL statements).  Files written with )DUMP can be
edited with normal text editors (vi, Emacs), read back with "apl -f", or
made executable (see scripting).

2.9.2 )DUMP-HTML Command
------------------------

The )DUMP-HTML command is similar to the )DUMP command.  The output
format is similar to the )DUMP command, the difference is that those
characters that need HTML-escaping (e.g.  ’<’ becomes &lt;, ’>’ becomes
’&gt;) are being HTML-escaped.  The output of the )DUMP-HTML command can
therefore be directly used by a web server to display workspace listings
(in order to share the code).

   The files written with command )DUMP-HTML have the extension .html.

   In addition to the APL code, the .html files produced have a short
HTML <head> section template.  The user should replace the fields marked
with ??????  with proper values (for the author, the copyright owner,
and a short description) before publishing the page.

2.9.3 )COPY_ONCE Command
------------------------

Command )COPY_ONCE copies all objects (variables, functions and
operators) from some other workspace into the current workspace similar
to )COPY. However, )COPY_ONCE does this only once; a second invocation
of )COPY_ONCE with the same workspace (and the same library reference
number) is silently being ignored.  This speeds up the )COPYing of
libraries that occur in several )DUMPed or )SAVEd workspace.

2.10 ]NEXTFILE and ]PUSHFILE Commands
=====================================

2.10.1 ]NEXTFILE
----------------

The debug command ]NEXTFILE, when used in an APL script file, terminates
the processing of that file and continues processing in the next script
file (if any) or else enters immediate execution mode.  Unlike )OFF
(which terminates the interpreter), ]NEXTFILE does not terminate the
interpreter but only changes its input source to the next script file
(if there is one remaining) and enters immediate execution only if all
scripts were processed.

   The user may, for example, want to use the space near the end of the
script to add longer comments (as to what the script does, how it works,
how it is used, etc.)  without the need to prepend every line with ⍝ or
#.

   For example:

#/usr/local/bin/apl

⍝ see documentation at the end of this file

<APL CODE...>

]NEXTFILE

This workspace does the following...


2.10.2 ]PUSHFILE
----------------

The debug command ]PUSHFILE is similar to ]NEXTFILE in that it
terminates the processing of the current script file.  Unlike ]NEXTFILE,
]PUSHFILE does not proceed to the next script file but enters a new
immediate execution context in which the user can interact with the
interpreter.  This context can be processes input until a ]NEXTFILE
command is given.  After the ]NEXTFILE that leaves the immediate
execution context processing proceeds at the next line after the
]PUSHFILE command.

2.11 History and TAB completion
===============================

Until GNU APL 1.4 / SVN 465, GNU APL used libreadline for interactive
user input.  libreadline did provide two useful features: tab expansion
(the tab key would expand file names) and history (the cursor up/down
keys would recall previously entered lines).

   Since SVN 465 libreadline was removed and the standard TAB expansion
and history of libreadline were replaced by more context sensitive (i.e.
APL aware) implementations:

   1.  Instead of simply recalling the last line entered by the user,
there are now different histories for different input contexts:

   1a.  The input history in immediate execution recalls the last line
entered in immediate execution (and not, for example, lines entered in
function editing mode or ⍞ input.

   1b.  Likewise, ⍞ recalls the last line entered for ⍞-input

   1c.  ⎕ recalls the last line entered for ⎕-input

   1d.  In the ∇-editor, the other function lines of the function being
edited can be recalled.  This is far more handy than the ∇-editor
commands for recalling function lines (and which are not fully supported
in GNU APL).

   2.  Instead of always TAB-completing file names, the tab character
now understands different TAB-completion contexts:

   2a.  Input starting with .  or / is completed as a filename like
readline did.

   2b.  Input starting with ) or ] is completed as command name name or,
to some extent, as command arguments.

   2c.  Input starting with ⎕ is completed as a system function name or
a system variable name.

   2d.  Input starting with letters, ∆, or ⍙ is completed as a user
defined function or variable name.

2.12 Logging Facilities
=======================

The APL interpreter has over 30 logging facilities.  Each logging
facility can be ON (and then produces some logging output on stderr) or
OFF. The decision which logging facility shall be ON and which shall be
OFF can be made at compile time (of the APL interpreter) or at run-time.

   If the decision is made at compile time - we call that static logging
- then it cannot be changed later on.  Otherwise - we call that dynamic
logging - there is a debug command ]LOG that allows to turn logging
facilities to be turned ON or OFF.

2.12.1 Static Logging
---------------------

By default the logging facilities that shall be turned ON are defined
statically.  To change the logging facilities that shall be turned ON,
you can edit the file src/Logging.def which defines the different
logging facilities.  The first argument of macro log_def() tells if the
logging facility shall be ON (1) or OFF (0).

   Static logging results in a faster interpreter than dynamic logging
because the decision if something shall be logged or not is made at
compile time and not at run-time.

   If you benchmark the APL interpreter, then ./configure Static Logging
by NOT setting DYNAMIC_LOG_WANTED=yes.

2.12.2 Dynamic Logging
----------------------

Dynamic Logging is intended for trouble-shooters of GNU APL, but also
for those who are interested in the internals of GNU APL. Dynamic
Logging is enabled by setting DYNAMIC_LOG_WANTED=yes when running
./configure.

   If Dynamic Logging is enabled, then the already mentioned file
src/Logging.def determines the initial setting of each logging facility.

   The command

   ]LOG

   (without arguments) then shows all logging facilities and their
current state.  The command

   ]LOG N

   toggles the state of logging facility N from OFF to ON and back.

2.13 Rational Numbers
=====================

GNU APL has limited support for rational numbers.  Instead of dividing
integers (and possibly causing rounding errors), integer quotients are
kept undivided internally until some function requires a conversion to a
floating point (double) value.

   Currently only +, -, ×, and ÷ preserve rational numbers where
possible, but this list may grow in the future.  Monadic + (a no-op for
non-complex numbers) explicitly converts rational numbers to floating
point numbers.

   A quotient is internally stored as a 64-bit numerator and a 64-bit
denominator.  In some cases arithmetic with rational numbers is faster
than with doubles, but in most cases it is slower.

   For that reason support for rational numbers is disabled by default
and must be enabled via ./configure (see README-2-configure).

2.14 Hex Numbers

2.15 User-defined Commands
==========================

There is a simple mechanism to define additional APL commands.  This
mechanism is intended to introduce new commands by APL libraries.  Like
system commands, user-define commands can only be executed in immediate
execution mode and not from user-defined functions or from ⍎.  It is not
intended to extend the functionality of user-defined commands beyond
what is being described in the following.

   A user-defined command ]NEW_COMMAND is created with the debug command
]USERCMD like this:

      ]USERCMD ]NEW_COMMAND APL_FUNCTION [mode]

   APL_FUNCTION is an APL function that will be called when the command
is entered in immediate execution mode.  The entire line entered by the
user, starting at ]NEW_COMMAND, is the right argument of APL_FUNCTION.
If mode is missing (or 0) then APL_FUNCTION is called monadically.  If
mode is 1 then APL_FUNCTION is called dyadically; the left argument is a
vector of strings that is the left argument broken down into individual
argument strings.

   The function APL_FUNCTION that implements a command need not exist
when the command is created.

   A single user-defined command ]UCMD, or all user-defined commands can
be deleted like this:

      ]USERCMD REMOVE ]UCMD
      ]USERCMD REMOVE-ALL

2.16 Structured Variables and Associative Arrays
================================================

GNU APL has implemented two features that are closely related because,
under the hood, they share the same implementation: structured variables
and associative arrays.

2.16.1 Structured Variables
---------------------------

A structured variable is an APL variable that contains several related
but otherwise independent sub-variables aka members.  Such structured
variables can be convenient for passing many related arguments to a
function, or for returning multiple results from a function.

   The different sub-variables of a structured variable are accessed by
the (top-level) name of the variable followed by a non-empty sequence of
member names, separated by ’.’.  In the following we will use uppercase
names for structured variables and lowercase names for their members.
For example:

      PERSON.address.street

   is a structured variable PERSON, which has a member address, and
PERSON.address is a structured (sub-)variable of PERSON which has a
member street.

   For a structured variable and all its sub-variables, the usual rules
for normal variables apply.  They can be created, erased, and even
passed as arguments to functions.

   A structured variable is created by assigning a value to one of its
members.  For example:

      PERSON.firstname ← 'Jane'   ⍝ create variable PERSON with member 'firstname'
      PERSON.lastname  ← 'Doe'    ⍝ add a second member 'lastname' to PERSON

   The depth of a newly created member can be more than one.  In this
case the intermediate members are created automatically.  For example:

      PERSON.address.street ←  '42 Main Street'   ⍝ implicitly creates PERSON.address

   Empty structured variables can be created with 38 ⎕CR:

      EMPTY ← 38 ⎕CR CAPACITY ← 32

   Note: A structured variable is automatically expanded when new
members are added to it.  From time to time this expansion exceeds the
space allocated for the members of the variable and then the existing
members need to be copied into a new, larger structure.  The overhead
caused by this reorganization can be avoided by specifying a
sufficiently large capacity when the structure is created (with 38 ⎕CR).

   An entire structured variable can be erased with ⎕EX or with )ERASE
just like other variables.  That erases the variable along with all its
members.  In addition to erasing an entire structured variable,
individual members at any depth can also be erased with ⎕EX or )ERASE:

      )ERASE PERSON.address      ⍝ OK, PERSON.address exists
      )ERASE PERSON.address      ⍝ error: PERSON.address does not exist anymore
NOT ERASED: PERSON.address

   After having been created, the members of a structured variable can
be referenced and overridden just like normal variables:

      PERSON.address.street ←  '42 Main Street'   ⍝ create member address.street
      PERSON.address.street   ⍝ reference member address.street of PERSON
42 Main Street

      PERSON.address.street ←  '44 Main Street'   ⍝ override address.street
      PERSON.address.street
44 Main Street

   The members of a structured variable form a tree of (sub-) variables,
similar to the file system on a computer.  This tree has:

   • one root (which is the structured variable itself),

   • zero or more non-leafs (like sub-directories of the top-level root
     directory), and

   • zero or more leafs.  The case of zero non-leafs occurs, for
     example, directly after a new empty variable was created with 38
     ⎕CR.

   Due to their tree-like structure, structured variables need to be
printed somewhat different than normal APL variables.  For example:

      PERSON
.firstname: ┌→───┐
            │Jane│
            └────┘

.lastname: ┌→──┐
           │Doe│
           └───┘

.address: 
.address.street: ┌→─────────────┐
                 │44 Main Street│
                 └──────────────┘

   Only the leafs of a deeply structured variable can have values and,
as a precaution, assigning a value to a non-leaf (including the root)
raises a DOMAIN ERROR:

      B.b.c←'leaf-Abc'        ⍝ OK, since B.b.c will be a leaf
      B.b←42                  ⍝ will fail since B.b is not a leaf
DOMAIN ERROR+
      B.b←42
       ^ ^
      )MORE
member access: cannot override non-leaf member A.b
)ERASE or ⎕EX that member first.

      )ERASE B.b
      B.b ← 'leaf-Ab'         ⍝ now OK, since B.b will now become a (new) leaf

      )SIC

   On the other hand, assigning a structured variable to the leaf of
another structured variable is valid and concatenates the members:

      )ERASE A
      A.b.c ← 'leaf-Abc'      ⍝ variable A with leaf A.b.c
      C.d.e ← 'leaf-cde'      ⍝ variable C with leaf C.d.e
      A.b.c ← C               ⍝ override leaf A.b.c of A
      A.b.c.d.e
leaf-cde

   The file src/testcases/Structured_variable.tc contains the examples
above (and more)

2.16.2 Associative Arrays
-------------------------

APL arrays are primarily indexed with numbers (or arrays of numbers),
which is also the most efficient method.  Many other languages provide,
in either addition or else alternatively, a method to index arrays by
keys, where the keys are frequently characters strings.  Such arrays are
commonly referred to as associative arrays.

   APL has no associative array per se, but the structured variables in
GNU APL can be used for the same purpose.  The only limitation is
(currently) that the keys need to be character strings (as opposed to
arbitrary APL values).

   That is, in GNU APL an associative array

   • is a structured variable, and
   • can be indexed with arbitrary (!)  strings

   As long as the strings that are used as keys follow the same rules as
APL variable names (no leading digit, no ’.’ etc.), a structured
variable can also be indexed with a string.  That can be useful if keys
are being computed or passed as function arguments.  However, unlike
indexing of APL arrays with numbers, only one key per (bracket-) index
is permitted.

   A.key ← 42
   A.key
42
   A['key']
42
   A['key']←24
   A.key
24
   A['key' 'key']   ⍝ not allowed even though 'key' is a valid member
DOMAIN ERROR
      D['key' 'key']


   Strings that do not follow the rules for variable names can be used
with bracket index, but not with the .member syntax:

      ASSOC ← 38 ⎕CR 8
      KEY←'key.dot'   ⍝ works, but avoid such keys
      ASSOC[KEY]←42
      ASSOC[KEY]
42
      ASSOC[KEY]←43
      ASSOC[KEY]
43
      ASSOC.key.dot   ⍝ won't work: 'key.dot' is a single key, but key.dot is 2 keys
VALUE ERROR+
      ASSOC.key.dot
               ^
      )MORE
member access: structure ASSOC has no member key

      ASSOC.key.dot←44   ⍝ works: 2 (nested) keys
      ASSOC.key.dot
44
      ASSOC['key.dot']   ⍝ works: one key containing '.'
43

   This is because ASSOC.key.dot above is being tokenized by the APL
parser into [ASSOC] [key] [dot], while ’key.dot’ is a single key.  The
example above (with different values for ASSOC.key.dot and for
ASSOC[’key.dot’] demonstrates why such keys are better avoided.

   Even though (one) bracket index can only access the top-level members
of a structured variable, repeated bracket index (or dyadic PICK) can be
used to access deeper nesting levels:

      D.b.c←42
      D['b.c']   ⍝ will fail
INDEX ERROR+
      D['b.c']
      ^^
      )MORE
member access: member b.c was not found. The valid members are:
      b

      D['b']['c']   ⍝ will work
42

      ⍝ alternatively: use PICK
      ⍝
      'b' 'c' ⊃ D   ⍝ fails: 'b' 'c' is 'ab'
      "b" "c" ⊃ D   ⍝ works
42


   In the above examples each bracket index (or each element of PICK)
discards the current top-level structure and descends into the
structured sub-variable of the chosen member.  In this case PICK is more
efficient since repeated bracket index creates copies of the
intermediate structured sub-variables.

   If a variable is used as a structured variable then the number of its
members is typically small (since every member name occurs explicitly in
the APL code that uses it).  If a variable is used as an associative
array, then the member names are typically being computed and the number
of members can become rather large (like the different key values in a
database).  When such a variable (i.e.  with many members) reaches its
capacity, then finding a member (when the array is indexed), or finding
an unused place in the variable (when a new member is added) becomes
slower and slower.  The GNU APL implementation has addressed this by
hashing into the variable (based on the member name) instead of, for
example, sequentially allocating the members.  This is very fast under
normal circumstances, but becomes as slow as sequential allocation when
the number of members in the variable reaches its current capacity.  For
this reason, if a structured variable is used as an associative array,
e.g.  as a database, then it is better to not rely on the (automatic)
reorganization of the variable, but to create the variable with a large
enough (with 38 ⎕CR) from the beginning.

   If that is not possible (because the (performance-) problem has
occurred after the variable was created, then one can manually increase
the capacity like this:

      TMP ← 39 ⎕CR ASSOC_ARRAY   ⍝ save ASSOC_ARRAY as normal APL array
      ⊣ ⎕EX 'ASSOC_ARRAY'        ⍝ erase it so that it can be assigned
      ASSOC_ARRAY ← 38 ⎕CR TMP   ⍝ new associative array with ≥ twice the size

   As a rule of thumb, associative arrays will be fast as long their
capacity is more than twice the number of their members.  The expression
ASSOC_ARRAY[;1] returns all keys (= members) of ASSOC_ARRAY, therefore
the number of members is ⍴ASSOC_ARRAY[;1] and the capacity is
↑⍴ASSOC_ARRAY.

2.17 Monadic ⊢ and ⊣, dyadic ⊢ with Axis
========================================

Monadic ⊢ is the identity function.  It returns its (committed or
non-committed) right argument as a non-committed value.

   Conversely, monadic ⊣ (called Hide in GNU APL) discards its
(committed or non-committed) right argument and returns a committed
integer scalar 0.

   For the most part there is no difference between a committed value (=
a value that was assigned to a variable, including ⎕ and ⍞) and a
non-committed value.  The point where it does make a difference is when
the value the final result of a statement (as opposed to an intermediate
result inside a statement).  In that situation (and only there) a
non-committed value is being printed while a committed value is not.

   You can use ⊢ is a similar fashion as ⎕← at the left end of a
statement, in order to print a value even though it was previously
assigned to a variable.

   The main motivation for ⊣ is that, at least in GNU APL, lambdas
always return a value.  However, if a lambda is used only for the sake
of its side effects, say to print something, then the value returned by
the lambda is often of no interest and only messes up the APL output.
In that situation ⊣ can be used to suppress the printing of undesired
return values from lambdas.

   In earlier GNU APL versions, ⊣B and ⊢B would both return B; with ⊣ as
committed value and with ⊢ as non-committed value.  But since the only
real-life purpose of ⊣ is to suppress the printing of B, the
implementation of ⊣ was changed to returning an committed integer scalar
0 instead of committed B. That reduced the run-time of ⊣B from O(,B) to
O(1).  Also, ⊢B is marginally faster than ⎕←B.

   Dyadic ⊢ with axis is a selection function that generalizes ⊣ and ⊢.

   Let Z←A ⊣[X] B. Then:

   • if X is a one-element vector and ↑X is 0 then Z ≡ A,
   • if X is a one-element vector and ↑X is 1 then Z ≡ B,
   • otherwise X selects corresponding items of A resp.  B if the
     correspondent elements of X are 0 or 1 respectively.  In that case,
     the shapes of A and B must match the shape of X, but one-element A
     or B are scalar extended to the shape of X.

   Example:

      A←2 3⍴'abcdef'
      B←2 3⍴⍳6
      X←2 3⍴0 1 0 1 0 1
      A ⊢[X] B
a 2 c
4 e 6

   A ⊢[X] '*'

2.18 Bit-wise Logical Functions ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ⊤⍲, ⊤⍱, T≠, and T=
==========================================================

The APL functions And (∧), Or (∨), Nand (⍲), and Nor (⍱) operate
primarily on Boolean integers.  Primarily means that the the LCM variant
for ∧ and the GCD variant for ∨ are not considered in this context.
(The LCM and GCD variants are defined in the ISO standard and supported
in GNU APL but not in IBM APL2).

   However, probably more often than not one needs to compute Boolean
functions between the bits of arbitrary (non-Boolean) integers and not
between entire Boolean integers 0 or 1.  Although that is possible to do
in standard APL, the procedure is fairly awkward and, more importantly,
inefficient:

   • convert every integer argument X to a 64-item Boolean vector
     X←(64⍴2)⊤X,
   • call the Boolean function ∧, ∨, ⍲, ⍱, =, or ≠ with the converted
     arguments, and
   • convert the Boolean result vector R back to the integer result
     Z←2⊥R

   Note: for Boolean arguments the APL functions ≠ resp.  = can be used
to compute the more customary Boolean functions XOR and XNOR. In this
context = and ≠ are treated as Boolean functions even though they accept
non-Boolean arguments,

   For example (using 5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤X to display X in hex):

      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   A←$ABBADEAD
ABBADEAD
      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   B←$00FF00FF
00FF00FF

      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ∧ (64⍴2)⊤B
00BA00AD


   With the bit-wise And (∣∧) the same can be achieved in a simpler
fashion and far more efficiently:

      ⍝ Traditional AND
      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   A←$ABBADEAD
ABBADEAD
      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   B←$00FF00FF
00FF00FF

      ⍝ bit-wise AND
      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   A ⊤∧ B
00BA00AD

2.18.1 Dyadic ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ⊤⍲, ⊤⍱, ⊤=, and ⊤≠
----------------------------------------

The dyadic forms of ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ⊤⍲, and ⊤⍱ are simply the bit-wise variants
of their Boolean counterparts:

      A ⊤∧ B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ∧ (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. AND
      A ⊤∨ B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ∨ (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. OR
      A ⊤⍲ B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ⍲ (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. NAND
      A ⊤⍱ B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ⍱ (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. NOR
      A ⊤≠ B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) ≠ (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. XOR
      A ⊤= B    ←→    2⊥ ((64⍴2)⊤A) = (64⍴2)⊤B      ⍝ aka. NXOR or XNOR

2.18.2 Monadic ⊤∨ and ⊤⍱
------------------------

⊤∧ and ⊤⍲ do not have a monadic form, but ⊤∧, ⊤∨, and ⊤⍱ do.  Formally
monadic ⊤∨ resp, ⊤⍱ are dyadic ⊤∨ resp, ⊤⍱ with a left argument of 0:

      ⊤∨ B    ←→    0 ⊤∨ B      ⍝ real B to nearby integer
      ⊤⍱ B    ←→    0 ⊤⍱ B      ⍝ bit-wise Not

   Even though Or-ing a Boolean vector with 0 itself has no effect, the
monadic ⊤∨ and ⊤⍱ are still useful due to their side effects: conversion
from near-integer float values to integers (monadic ⊤∨ and inversion of
the bits (monadic ⊤⍱, The latter is needed since ∼ has a monadic form
and as a consequence ⊤∼ was not an option for a bit-wise Not function.

   Monadic ⊤⍱ B is the bit-wise Not function of its argument:

   ⊤⍱ B ←→ 2⊥ ~(64⍴2)⊤B

   Monadic ⊤∨ B converts near-integer values B into true integers:

      26 ⎕CR    1            ⍝ integer
16
      26 ⎕CR    1.1          ⍝ real
32
      26 ⎕CR    1÷1          ⍝ integer
16
      26 ⎕CR    1.1÷1.1      ⍝ real
32
      26 ⎕CR    ⊤∨ 1.1÷1.1   ⍝ integer
16

   That also works for complex numbers with a near-zero imaginary part:

      26 ⎕CR    1.1J0÷1.1      ⍝ real
32
      26 ⎕CR    ⊤∨ 1.1J0÷1.1      ⍝ integer
16

   As a matter of fact, ⊤∨ works for all near-Gaussian complex numbers,
but the effect is not visible with 26 ⎕CR since Gaussian and
non-Gaussian complex numbers have the same cell type in GNU APL.

2.18.3 Monadic ⊤∧
-----------------

The ISO standard defines two different concepts to decide if a real
number R is close to an integer I,
   • the real number R is said to be near to integer I if the absolute
     value of I-R is smaller than some small constant called the integer
     tolerance in ISO and system tolerance in IBM APL2.  The integer
     tolerance is typically platform dependent (1E¯10 in GNU APL).

   • the real number R is said to be equal to integer I within ⎕CT if
     the absolute value of (I-R)/I is smaller than ⎕CT.

   The first concept is an absolute distance from a real R to a nearby
integer I while the second concept is a relative distance (larger
numbers are allowed to be farther away from a nearby integer than
smaller numbers).  The two concepts differ in the same way that absolute
and relative errors do.

   Now, all bit-wise functions described so far use the first concept,
i,e, if their their arguments are real or complex, then the smallest
distance to a (nearby) integer must not exceed the integer tolerance.
In some contexts that could be difficult to achieve and for that reason
GNU APL provides monadic ⊤∧ which works like ⊤∨ except that the
permitted distance from a nearby integer is now controlled by ⎕CT rather
than by the integer tolerance.

   All bit-wise logical functions throw a DOMAIN ERROR if an argument is
not close enough to an integer.  integer tolerance is typically smaller
than ⎕CT and in that case is ⊤∧ little more tolerant than ⊤∨ regarding
the distance to nearby integers.  In addition ⊤∧ gives the user (via
⎕CT) more control over the permitted tolerance for real numbers in the
neighborhood of integers.

2.18.4 Character Arguments for Monadic ⊤⍱ and Dyadic ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ==, and ≠≠
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the bit-wise operations are allowed to have characters as their
right argument.  If the right argument is a character then the result is
a character as well.  This can be useful for masking purposes such as
extracting the lower 7 bits of 8-bit bytes containing ASCII characters.

   The characters involved are treated as 32 bit quantities:

      5 ⎕CR 'A'
41
      5 ⎕CR ⊤⍱'A'                       ⍝ Note that 5 ⎕CR ANDs with $FF
BE

      256 256 256 256⊤ ⎕UCS ⊤⍱ 'A'      ⍝ ⊤⍱ 'A' is FFFFFFBE
255 255 255 190
      256 256 256 256⊤$FFFFFFBE
255 255 255 190

2.19 Generalized ⍳
==================

2.19.1 Generalized monadic ⍳
----------------------------

The standard function Interval (Z←⍳B) requires its argument B to be a
scalar or a length 1 vector.  The result Z←⍳B then contains all possible
indices of values which have shape B.

   Generalized monadic ⍳ extends this concept to integer vectors B with
more than 1 element.  The result Z←⍳B again contains all possible
indices of a value which has shape B, but the rank of B can now be more
than 1.  The items of Z are nested integer vectors as opposed to integer
scalars in the standard case.

2.19.2 Generalized dyadic ⍳
---------------------------

The standard function Index Of (Z←A⍳B) requires its left argument A to
be a scalar or a vector of rank 1.  The items of the result Z are the
(first) positions (= indices) of the corresponding items of B in A (for
the items found in A) or else ⎕IO+⍴A (which is an invalid index of A)
for the items of B that are not found in A.

   Generalized dyadic ⍳ extends this concept to find the (first) indices
of the corresponding items of B in A (in ravel order) where the rank of
A is > 1.  Each item of the result Z is then either a nested integer
vector (if the item was found) or - different from the standard case (!)
- the empty vector ⍬ if the item was not found).

2.20 ⌹[X] - QR Factorization
============================

Z←⌹[X] B computes a QR factorization of the real or complex matrix B.
The axis argument X is used to clear near-0 matrix items to exactly 0.0
during the computation.  Set X←⎕CT if unsure.

   The result Z is a triple (QT R Ri)←Z with the following properties.
Let ⍴B=(M, N).

   * QT is an orthogonal M×M matrix, i.e QT^{-1} = QT^{T}, resp.  QT +.×
⍉QT is the M×M identity matrix I_{M} (with I_{M}←∘.=⍨⍳M).

   * R is an upper triangular M×N matrix, i.e.  R[m;n] = 0 for n < m,
and

   * Ri is the inverse of R, i.e.  Ri +.× R is the identity matrix
I_{N}.

   * (⍉QT) +.× R = B.

   Note that, unlike in standard QR factorizations, the matrix QT
returned by ⌹[X] is already inverted (i.e.  transposed since QT is
orthogonal).  The reason is that the algorithm used can transpose Q with
no extra cost and usually the first step after a QR factorization is to
transpose the returned Q matrix.  This first transpose step is therefore
not needed.

2.21 Dyadic ⎕CR
===============

The ⎕CR function has an optional left argument that selects one of
several formatting styles and conversion functions in addition to the
well-known monadic form.

   Calling ⎕CR monadically without an axis and with an empty right
argument shows a list of all functions provided by ⎕CR:

      ⎕CR ''

   Say a byte vector is an integer vector with numbers having a (signed
or unsigned) 8-bit value (i.e.  a value from -128 to 255 inclusive).
Such byte vectors are frequently used arguments and results of ⎕FIO
functions.

   Let Z←A ⎕CR B.

   Then the left argument A of ⎕CR selects one of several sub-functions
of ⎕CR:

   A=0-4 or 7-9, or 29: various formatting styles (boxed, APL
input/output, etc.).  Just try them out.

   A=5 resp.  A=6: convert byte vector B to a string of uppercase resp.
lowercase hex digits.  Every byte in B becomes 2 characters in Z.

   A=10: convert variable named in B to an APL expression producing it.

   A=11: convert value B to byte vector Z in CDR ("Common Data
Representation", an IBM standard) format (similar to 3 ⎕TF).

   A=12: convert byte vector Z in CDR format to value Z.

   A=13: convert hex string B to byte vector Z.

   If a conversion has an inverse conversion (like 12 being the inverse
of 11) then the inverse conversion can be expressed as the negative of
the conversion number.  For example, 12 ⎕CR B is the same as ¯11 ⎕CR B.

   A=14: conversion 11 followed by conversion 13 (Value to hex string in
CDR format)

   A=15: conversion 13 followed by conversion 12 (hex string in CDR
format to Value)

   A=16: encode byte vector B into Z (base64 encoding, RFC 4648)

   A=17: decode base64 vector B into byte vector Z (base64 encoding, RFC
4648)

   A=18: convert text vector B into byte vector Z (UTF8 encoding, RFC
3629)

   A=19: convert byte vector B into text vector Z (UTF8 encoding, RFC
3629)

   A=20-25: like 3,4,7-9 but using a formatting similar to NARS APL ⎕FMT
(showing the axis lengths as numbers instead of → and ↓)

   A=26: Z is the cell types of the ravel elements of B (2: character,
16: integer, 32: real number, 64: complex number.

   A=27: Z[I] is the primary data representation (for example the real
part of a complex number, or the numerator of a rational number) of
B[I].

   A=28: Z[I] is the additional data representation (for example the
imaginary part of a complex number, or the denominator of a rational
number) of B[I].

   A=30: Z is B with all top-level elements conformed to a common rank
and shape (as required by the ⍤ operator).  This conversion is primarily
used internally bu the GNU APL interpreter.

   A=31 or A=32: These conversions are used internally by ⎕INP.

   A=33: convert tagged byte vector to a TLV (Tag/Length/Value) buffer.
The TLV buffer can be sent over a byte stream (socket) and easily
decoded at the other end.  Say B = B[1], B[2], ..., B[n] such that B1 is
an Integer (the tag) and B[j] is a character in the range 0.255 for j >
1.  Let Z←33 ⎕CR B with Z = Z[1], Z[2], ...  Z[m].  Then Z[1 2 3 4] is
the 4 byte tag, Z[5 6 7 8] is the 4 byte data length (n-1) == (m - 8)
and 1↓B == 8 ↓ Z. In other words, the first 4 bytes of Z are the tag in
big endian byte order, the next 4 bytes are the length of B except the
tag, and the rest of Z is B except the tag.

   Example:
      Tag←55   ⍝ hex 37
      5 ⎕CR 33 ⎕CR Tag,'Value'
000000370000000556616C7565

   A=34: this is the inverse of 33 ⎕CR. The intended use for 33 ⎕CR and
34 ⎕CR is the transmission of a tagged byte vector over e.g a TCP
socket:

   Sender Receiver —— ——– T,Data →→→ 33 ⎕CR T,Data →→→TCP connection→→→
34 ⎕CR T,Data →→→ T,Data

   Example:
      34 ⎕CR ¯5 ⎕CR '000000370000000556616C7565'
55 Value

   The TLVs constructed by 33 ⎕CR can be sent back-to-back over a TCP
connection or similar in such a way that the receiver knows exactly
after which byte a TLV ends, which is perfect for connections over which
data is sent sporadically.  33 ⎕CR and 34 ⎕CR are particularly useful
for encoding and decoding TLV byte buffers exchanged between GNU APL and
processes that were forked by GNU APL with ⎕FIO[57] (aka.  fork() and
execve()).

   Most dyadic ⎕CR variants whose argument B is expected to be a byte
vector throw:

  1. RANK ERROR if 1≠⍴⍴B
  2. DOMAIN ERROR if one of the B[j] is not a proper byte value

   A proper byte value is either an integer in the range -128...255
including, or a (Unicode) character with a code point between U+FF80 and
U+FFFF (including, corresponding to a negative signed char in C/C++) or
between U+0000...U+00FF (including, corresponding to an unsigned char or
to a signed positive char in C/C++).  Real, Complex, or rational numbers
are never proper byte values even if their value is close to an integer.
Nor are nested APL values or values being assigned.

2.22 Dyadic ⎕FX (Native Functions)
==================================

A Native Function is a function that can be called in APL like a normal
user defined APL function, but is implemented in C++.

   A native function is created with A ⎕FX B. A is a string that is the
path of a shared library and B is the name of the function in APL.

   The GNU APL package contains a shared library file_io.so that
contains the implementation of a native function for reading and writing
files (fopen(), fclose(), ...), For example:

      ⍝ fix native function in lib_file_io.so as FILE_IO
      ⍝
      'lib_file_io.so' ⎕FX 'FILE_IO'
FILE_IO

      ⍝ show overview of sub-functions in FILE_IO
      ⍝
      FILE_IO ''
   Functions provided by this library.
   Assumes 'lib_file_io.so'  ⎕FX  'FUN'

   Legend: e - error code
           i - integer
           h - file handle (integer)
           s - string
           A1, A2, ...  nested vector with elements A1, A2, ...

   Recent versions of GNU APL have replaced the native FILE_IO function
above by the system function ⎕FIO. ⎕FIO need not be ⎕FX’ed and is
otherwise backward compatible to the native function.  New function
numbers are, however, only added to ⎕FIO and not to the old native
function FILE_IO. The parameters of the functions are described in the
man pages for, e.g.  strerror, fopen, ...  and are fairly obvious.

   Many functions in FILE_IO have byte vectors as arguments or return
byte vectors.  A byte vector is an integer vector whose numbers fit into
a byte (so they are integers between -128 and 255).  Often ⎕UCS and the
functions in dyadic ⎕CR are used to convert such byte vectors to/from,
for example, Unicode strings.

   The GNU APL package also contains other shared libraries as templates
for your own native functions.  Copy one of the files
src/native/template_F0.cc (for niladic native functions),
src/native/template_F12.cc (for nomadic native functions),
src/native/template_OP1.cc (for monadic native operators), or
src/native/template_OP2/cc (for dyadic native operators) to your own .cc
file and adjust src/native/Makefile.am accordingly.

   Note: The )IN and )OUT commands of GNU APL support native functions,
but in order to do so they have to use dyadic ⎕FX. This renders the
workspace interchange file (.atf files) written by )OUT incompatible
with all other APL interpreters if the workspace contains native
functions.  The )OUT command prints a warning when the )OUT command is
used with a workspace that contains native functions.

   Note: As of GNU APL 1.6, the native function FILE_IO has been turned
into the system function ⎕FIO. The syntax of ⎕FIO is the same as for
FILE_IO. The )CLEAR workspace command will close all open files.

2.24 ⎕DLX - Knuth’s Dancing Links Algorithm
===========================================

⎕DLX is an implementation of Donald Knuth’s Dancing Links Algorithm
(called DLX by Knuth himself, but is sometimes also referred to as
Knuth’s Algorithm X) ⎕DLX is a generic backtracking machinery that can
be used to dramatically simplify problems like the 8 queens problem on a
chess board or sudokus.

   The monadic form of ⎕DLX, i.e.  ⎕DLX B, is a shortcut for 0 ⎕DLX B.
It computes the first solution for the constraint matrix B.

   The dyadic form of ⎕DLX, i.e.  A ⎕DLX B, has a integer scalar A as
left argument which determines the details of the computation as
follows:

   A > 0: The algorithm tries to find all solutions, but stops when A
solutions have been found.  This is handy while debugging code using
⎕DLX. The result is a nested vector with one vector item per solution.

   A = 0: The algorithm stops when the first solution was found.  In
this case the solution is a simple (non-nested) numeric vector.

   A = ¯1: like A > 0 but finding all solutions

   A = ¯2: like A = 0 but instead of returning the first solution, the
number of solutions (i.e.  0 or 1), the number of backtracks, and the
number of link dances is returned as a 3-element numeric vector.

   A = ¯3: like A = ¯1 but instead of returning all solutions, the
number of solutions, the number of backtracks, and the number of link
dances is returned as a 3-element numeric vector.

   A = ¯4: A number of single step in Knuth’s Algorithm are performed.
Let e.g.  A←¯4 r1 r2 r3.  Then Z←A ⎕DLX B is the matrix B after 3 steps
r1, r2, and r3 have been performed.  r1, r2, and r3 are valid (as per
⎕IO) row numbers of B, and a step with a given row changes B as follows:
   • the given row is set to 0 (this row becomes part of the final
     result),
   • all other rows that have a 1 or a 2 in the same column as B are set
     to 0 (these 1s or 2s in the other rows conflict with the 1 or 2 in
     the given row and are therefore removed from B), and
   • all columns that have no 1s or 2s left are removed from B (these
     columns have a 1 or 2 in B and the constraint is therefore
     satisfied).
   The purpose of ¯4 ⎕DLX is:
   • To demonstrate how Knuth’s algorithm works, and/or
   • To preset some initial values in B. For example one can first
     initialize the constraints for an empty Sudoku (which is the same
     matrix for all Sudokus) and then enter the initial digits of a
     particular Sudoku using 4 ⎕DLX. If there are, say, 20 initial
     digits in the Sudoku then A has 21 elements (¯4 plus the 20 rows
     representing the 20 initial digits.  The result of ¯4 ⎕DLX B has
     the same number of rows as B (with some rows now cleared), but
     fewer columns than B.

   The right argument B of ⎕DLX B or A ⎕DLX B is a constraints matrix
whose columns consist of either 0s and 1s (called a primary column) or
0s and 2s (called secondary columns).  The 0s, 1s and 2s can be the
integers 0, 1, or 2, characters ’0’, ’1’, or ’2’ respectively, or ’ ’
meaning ’0’.  The character representation is useful when B becomes
large and shall be printed because the spaces in the numerical variant
will not be printed.  In the following, B is assumed to be numeric.

   Let Z←A ⎕DLX B, and let R be a solution in Z, that is, Z itself (A =
0) or R is Z[k] for some k if A ≠ 0.  And let S←+⌿B[R].

   Then S = s1 s2 s3, ...  sN where N is the number of columns in B and
sj=1 if j is a primary column of B and sj∈0 1 if j is a secondary column
of B.

   In other words, ⎕DLX B computes a subset of the rows of B in such a
way that for every column j of B exactly one (for primary column j) or
at most one (for a secondary column) of the rows in a solution has its
j’th element set to 1 and all other words set their j’th element set to
0.

   In yet other words, for every solution returned by ⎕DLX B, a 1 in one
row prevents all other rows that also have a 1 in that column, and all
rows together have exactly one 1 in every primary column and at most one
1 in every secondary column.  In the absence of secondary columns, the
problem solved by ⎕DLX is also known as the "exact cover problem"

   If all that sounds weird and useless, consider the following APL
program for finding all solutions of the 8 Queens problem on a chess
board (which probably every programmer has programmed at some point in
time):

      RC←8↑'1' ◊ D←15↑¯8↑'2'   ⍝ helpers for constructing Q8
      ⍝     rows   cols   diag1    diag2
      Q8←⊃{(R⌽RC),(C⌽RC),((C-R)⌽D),((¯7-R+C)⌽D)⊣(R C)←-8 8⊤⍵-⎕IO} ¨ ⍳64
      Z←¯1 ⎕DLX Q8
      {⎕UCS (65+⌊⍵÷8)(49+8∣⍵←⍵-⎕IO)} ¨ ⊃Z[1 2 3 92] ⍝ solutions 1, 2, 3, and 92
 A1 B5 C8 D6 G2 E3 F7 H4 
 A1 B6 C8 D3 E7 F4 G2 H5 
 A1 B7 C4 E8 D6 G5 F2 H3

      8 8⍴("+" "Q")[⎕IO+(⍳64)∈⊃Z[1]]   ⍝ visualize solution Z[1]

 + + + + + Q + + 
 + + Q + + + + + 
 + + + + + + Q + 
 + Q + + + + + + 
 + + + Q + + + + 


   Obviously Z contains solutions for the 8 Queens problem; the total
number of solutions is well known to be 92 and we showed only the first
two and the last solution above.

   The constraint matrix Q8 is the key to success.  The matrix has 64
rows - one row for every field of the chess board.  And it has 8 + 8 +
15 + 15 columns.  The first 8 columns of Q8 are constraints that prevent
more than one Queen to be placed in the same row of the chess board (the
argument ⍵ is the field number counting from left to right and from
bottom to top).  The next 8 columns of Q8 are constraints that prevent
more than one Queen to be placed in the same column of the chess board.

   If we would call ⎕DLX with only these constraints, i.e.  ⎕DLX T8←64
16↑Q8, then we would get the solutions of the 8 tower problem.  However,
we continue and add 15 more constraints for each of the two diagonals.
The resulting constraint matrix Q8 is this:

      Q8

   And that’s it: call ⎕DLX to get the solution(s).  In general all
problems that can be solved by ⎕DLX contain 3 steps:

   • translate the problem into a constraints matrix B,
   • Z←⎕DLX B, and
   • translate the result Z back into the problem domain.

   Another application of ⎕DLX is solving sudokus.  The constraints
matrix is a little more complicated, but the principle is the same.  GNU
APL is shipped with two workspaces: sudoku.apl (which solves sudokus
without using ⎕DLX) and sudoku_DLX.apl (which solves sudokus using
⎕DLX).

2.26 ⎕FIO - File I/O Functions
==============================

As of GNU APL 1.6, the native function FILE_IO has been replaced by the
system function ⎕FIO. ⎕FIO normally takes a numeric axis argument which
selects one of many different functions, most of which are contained in
the standard C library.  The arguments for these function are usually
the same as the corresponding C function and the man page for each
functions describes the meaning of the arguments.

   For example, ⎕FIO[3] corresponds to fopen() and ’man fopen’ explains
what fopen does (opening a file).

   Calling ⎕FIO monadically without an axis and with an empty right
argument shows a list of all functions provided by ⎕FIO:

      ⎕FIO ''
   Functions provided by ⎕FIO...

   Legend: a - address family, IPv4 address, port (or errno)
           d - table of dirent structs
           e - error code (integer as per errno.h)
           h - file handle (integer)
           i - integer
           n - names (nested vector of strings)
           s - string

   A new feature of ⎕FIO (which is not available with the native
function FILE_IO) is ⎕FIO[49].  ⎕FIO[49] is a monadic operator which
takes a monadic conversion function as function argument.  For example:

     Z←F ⎕FIO[49] 'filename'

   reads the file named filename line by line.  For every line read, the
conversion function F is called and the result returned by F is enclosed
and stored in Z. In other words,

     Z←F ⎕FIO[49] 'filename'

   does:

     Z F¨Z←⎕FIO[49] 'filename'

2.27 ⎕FFT - Fast Fourier Transform
==================================

For those interested in signal processing and the like, GNU APL provides
⎕FFT:

   The monadic form ⎕FFT B is a shortcut for the dyadic form 0 ⎕FFT B.
It computes the FFT of complex or real B without applying a window
function.

   The dyadic form A ⎕FFT B provides more control over what ⎕FFT
computes.  A is an integer scalar which falls into one of three ranges.

   The first range from ¯15 to ¯10 does not compute an FFT, but returns
the result of multiplying B with one of several window functions, that
are frequently used in the context of FFTs.  The result has same shape
as B and can be used for analyzing or troubleshooting FFTs:

   • A=¯10: no FFT, return the Hann window applied to B
   • A=¯11: no FFT, return the Hamming window applied to B
   • A=¯12: no FFT, return the Blackman window applied to B
   • A=¯13: no FFT, return the Blackman-Harris window applied to B
   • A=¯14: no FFT, return the Blackman-Nuttal window applied to B
   • A=¯15: no FFT, return the Flat-Top window applied to B

   The second range around 0 contains the computation of the forward and
inverse FFTs:

   • 0 ⎕FFT B returns the "normal" (aka.  forward) FFT of the numeric
     array B.
   • ¯1 ⎕FFT B returns the inverse FFT of the numeric array B.

   The third range from 10 to 15 corresponds to the first range and
first multiplies B with a window function and then computes the FFT:

   • A=10: FFT(B × Hann window)
   • A=11: FFT(B × Hamming window)
   • A=12: FFT(B × Blackman window)
   • A=13: FFT(B × Blackman-Harris window)
   • A=14: FFT(B × Blackman-Nuttal window)
   • A=15: FFT(B × Flat-Top window)

   ⍴⍴B can be 1 (one-dimensional FFT, the most common case) or more.
The implementation of ⎕FFT uses libfftw3, aka.  "The fastest Fourier
Transform in the West".  GNU APL checks the presence of libfftw3 when it
is ./configure’d.  If libfftw3 is present then ⎕FFT will hopefully
return the expected result; if not then a DOMAIN ERROR will be raised
when ⎕FFT is being used.

   ⎕FFT honors the presence of /etc/fftw/wisdom (see man fftw-wisdom) to
speed up the computations performed by ⎕FFT. Creating /etc/fftw/wisdom
will take a few hours, though, so that creating it will not pay off for
most mortals.

2.28 ⎕GTK - GTK Interface
=========================

GTK (Gimp Toolkit) is a rather powerful library for creating graphical
user interfaces (GUIs).  ⎕GTK makes a subset of the almost 10000
functions in the different GTK libraries available to GNU APL programs.
With ⎕GTK a GNU APL program can, for example, replace the somewhat crude
⎕ or ⍞ input methods of standard APL with a more intuitive GUI.

   The details of using ⎕GTK would go far beyond the scope of this info
manual and has therefore been put into a separate document.  See:
HOWTOs/Quad-GTK.html.

2.29 ⎕JSON - JSON Parsing
=========================

GNU APL provides ⎕JSON for decoding and encoding JSON strings and files.
A (valid) JSON string is mapped to an APL value as follows:

   • JSON value ←→ structured or non-structured APL value
   • JSON number ←→ APL number
   • JSON string ←→ APL string
   • JSON literal ←→ enclosed APL string (one of either ⊂’null’,
     ⊂’true’, or ⊂’false’ )
   • JSON array ←→ APL vector
   • JSON object ←→ structured APL value (associative array)

2.29.1 Monadic ⎕JSON
--------------------

Z←⎕JSON B converts the string B into an APL value according to the
mapping above.  If that fails then command )MORE provides information
about the error and where in B the error was detected.

2.29.2 Dyadic ⎕JSON
-------------------

Z←A ⎕JSON B performs one of the following conversions:

   • Z←0 ⎕JSON B is the same as monadic Z←⎕JSON B.

   • Z←1 ⎕JSON B is like Z←0 ⎕XML B, except that B is not the JSON
     string itself but the name of a file from which an JSON string is
     read.

   • Z←2 ⎕JSON B is the inverse of Z←0 ⎕XML B. It converts an APL value
     to a JSON string.

   • Z←3 ⎕JSON B is like 2 ⎕JSON B, except that the member names (keys)
     of all JSON objects are sorted alphabetically.  That is of little
     use (but costs perfomance) if Z is not displayed but processed
     further, but it could help troubleshooting when Z is displayed and
     the number of keys in Z is large.

2.30 ⎕MAP - Map Value
=====================

⎕MAP changes the ravel items of its right argument according to a
mapping table provided as its left argument.  Let Z←A ⎕MAP B.

   The left argument A of Z←A ⎕MAP B shall be a N×2 matrix.  Each
2-element row of A, say A[J;], specifies a separate mapping A[J;1] →
A[J;2].  The result Z has the same shape as the right argument B. The
items Z[...]  iof ther result are constructed from their corresponding
items B[...]  in B as follows:

   • if B[...]  ≡ A[J;1] for some J then Z[...]  is A[J;2].

   • otherwise B[...]  is different from all A[1;J] and then Z[...]  is
     B[...]

   In other words, Z is B, but with items of B found in A[;1] replaced
by their mapped item A[;2].

   In practice th left argument A is frequently created from a literal
APL value such as 5 2⍴’eEwWaAzZ92’ in the example below.  To simplify
these cases, A ⎕MAP B also accepts a vector instead of a N×2 matrix:

   A ⎕MAP B ←→ ((N 2)⍴A) ⎕MAP B if (2×N) ←→ ⍴A

   Examples:

      ⍝ the map A
      ⊢A←5 2⍴'eEwWaAzZ92'
eE    ⍝ map 'e' → 'E'
wW    ⍝ map 'w' → 'W'
aA    ⍝ map 'a' → 'A'
zZ    ⍝ map 'z' → 'Z'
92    ⍝ map '9' → '2'

      ⍝ the value B being mapped
      ⊢B←'Halloween'
Halloween

      ⍝ the result of A ⎕MAP B
      A ⎕MAP B
HAlloWEEn

      A←'eEwWaAzZ92'   ⍝ vector A instead of N×2 matrix
      A ⎕MAP B
HAlloWEEn


   NOTES:
   • The keys of the mapping A (i.e.  the elements in column A[;1]) must
     be unique.  If they are not then the mapping is ambiguous and a
     DOMAIN ERROR is raised.

   • Nested items in B: if an item of B is nested, then it is either
     equal to some (also nested) key, say A[N;1], (in that case it is
     being mapped to A[N;2] in the result), or it is different from all
     keys in A[;1] (and in that case the corresponding item in the
     result is the item in B.

   • Nested items in A: if a key, say A[N;1], is nested and matches an
     equal (hence also nested) item in B, then the corresponding item in
     the result will be A[N;2] (which may or may not be nested).  If a
     (nested or not nested) key A[N;1] is equal to an item in B, then
     the corresponding item in the result will be nested iff A[N;2] is
     nested.  If, for some N, the depths of A[N;1] and A[N;2] differ,
     then then depths of B and A ⎕MAP B may differ as well.  That is,
     ⎕MAP conserves the shape of B, but not necessarily the depth of B.

   • 
     By default the mapping of B is non-recursive, i.e.  the top-level
     items of B are compared with the top-level keys A[;1], and nested
     keys and items of B are handled as described above.

     Sometrimes, however, it is desirable to recursively descend into
     the nested sub-values of B (though never of A). This can be
     achieved by enclosing A as shown in the examples below.

      A←5 2⍴'eEwWaAzZ92'
      B←'Hal' 'low' 'een'   ⍝ nested B
      4 ⎕CR A ⎕MAP B        ⍝ non-recursive (none of the keys in A[;1] matches)

2.31 ⎕PLOT - Plot Data
======================

⎕PLOT is a function for visualizing numerical APL values.  The values to
be plotted are provided as the right argument of ⎕PLOT while the
optional left argument controls details of the output, such as the plot
window size, colors for lines and grids, etc.

   The general syntax of ⎕PLOT is:

   ⎕PLOT ''      ⍝ show a list of attributes and their default values
   H←⎕PLOT B     ⍝ plot B with all attributes set to their default values
   H←A ⎕PLOT B   ⍝ plot B with some of the default attributes overridden
   ⎕PLOT H       ⍝ close the plot window with handle H
   ⎕PLOT  0      ⍝ verbosity: OFF (do not print attribute values)
   ⎕PLOT ¯1      ⍝ verbosity: ON (print attribute values before plotting)
   ⎕PLOT ¯2      ⍝ verbosity: DEBUG (also print debug information)
   ⎕PLOT ¯3      ⍝ close all plot windows

* Menu:

* Output File Format::

2.31.1 The Plot Data B
----------------------

The Plot Data B can be a vector (in that case a single plot line is
being plotted) or a matrix (in that case one plot line per matrix row is
being plotted, by default in different colors).  Each data item has to
be numeric and represents one point in the plot.  The points that are
adjacent in a row of the matrix are connected by lines.  By default
plotted points and the lines connecting them have the same color.
However, all colors used, all diameters of points, and all thicknesses
of the lines can be controlled by overriding the default values (dyadic
A ⎕PLOT B).

2.31.1.1 Complex Plot Data B
............................

If a data item B[N] or B[row;N] is complex, say B[N] = x + iy.  then it
is placed (after some scaling) at position (x, y) of the plot.  The
X-range [Xmin ...  Xmax] of the plot is then determined by the real
parts of B, and the Y-range [Ymin ...  Ymax] of the plot is determined
by the imaginary parts of B. That is:

Xmin ← ⌊/,9○B    ⍝ smallest real part of B
Xmax ← ⌈/,9○B    ⍝ largest real part of B
Ymin ← ⌊/,11○B   ⍝ smallest imaginary part of B
Ymax ← ⌈/,11○B   ⍝ largest imaginary part of B

   Example (plot a circle (actually: a regular 20-gon)):

      ⎕PLOT +⌿1 0J1×[1]1 2 ∘.○ (0,⍳2×N) × ○÷N←10

   produces this plot window (only visible in the HTML version of this
document; in text mode see file doc/PLOT_circle.png):

 [image src="PLOT_circle.png" ]

2.31.1.2 Real Plot Data B
.........................

On the other hand, if a data item B[N] or B[row;N] is real, then it is
placed at position (N, x) of the plot.  The X-range is then [⎕IO ...
⎕IO + ¯1↑⍴B] and the Y-range [Y_{min} ...  Y_{max}] of the plot is
determined by the values parts of B. That is:

Xmin ← ⎕IO             ⍝ smallest real part of B
Xmax ← ¯1 + ⎕IO + ⍴B   ⍝ largest real part of B
Ymin ← ⌊/,B            ⍝ smallest value in B
Ymax ← ⌈/,B            ⍝ largest value in B

   Example:

      ⎕PLOT 0 1 ¯1 2 ¯2 3 ¯3

   produces this plot window (only visible in the HTML version of this
document; in text mode see file doc/PLOT_zigzag.png):

 [image src="PLOT_zigzag.png" ]

   NOTE: In theory one can also mix real and complex values, even though
doing so makes little sense.  If at least one item of the plot data B is
complex, then all real items in B are taken as complex with imaginary
part 0.

2.31.2 The Plot Attributes A
----------------------------

There are a number of attributes like colors, point sizes, line widths,
etc.  that control how the resulting plot will look like.

   Similar to ⎕CR and ⎕FIO, an empty argument B in ⎕PLOT B displays a
list of the arguments.  The list of arguments grows over time and
therefore the list displayed by ⎕PLOT ” may be more up-to-date than this
description.  For example:


   ⎕PLOT Usage:

   ⎕PLOT B     plot B with default attribute values
   A ⎕PLOT B   plot B with attributes specified by A

   A is a nested vector of strings.
   Each string A[i] has the form "Attribute: Value"
   Colors are specified either as #RGB or as #RRGGBB or as RR GG BB)

   The attributes understood by ⎕PLOT and their default values are:

   1. Global (plot window) Attributes:

   2. Local (plot line N) Attributes:

line_style-N:       1              (line style, see gridX_style above)
line_width-N:       3 pixel        (the thickness of plot line N)
point_color-N:      #000000        (the color of the plot points)
point_style-N:      1              (= plot_points: ● )
                   (2)             (= plot_points: ▲ )
                   (3)             (= plot_points: ▼ )
                   (4)             (= plot_points: ◆ )
                   (5)             (= plot_points: ■ )
                   (6)             (= plot_points: 🞤   (GTK only)
                   (7)             (= plot_points: 🞫   (GTK only)

point_size2-N:      0 pixel        (the inner diameter of the plot points)
legend_name-N:                     (the name of plot line N in the legend)


   There are 2 kinds of attributes: global attributes that affect the
entire plot, and local (per-line) attributes that affect one of the plot
lines (which corresponds to one row of B). One way to specify multiple
attributes in one go is to use multi-line strings.

   For example (plot 2 lines of 10 random numbers each, named "random
row 1" and "random row 2"):

      Data ← ?2 10⍴10   ⍝ two rows of random data
      Attributes  ← """
legend_name-1: Random Row 1
legend_name-2: Random Row 2
                    """
      Attributes ⎕PLOT Data

   While specifying the plot attributes A in one place is most
convenient for a single plot window or when the attributes are read from
some external test file, its is somretimes simpler to specify the plot
attributes individually.  This can be done by using a structured APL
variable as left argument A:

Attributes.legend_name_1 ← "Random Row 1"
Attributes.legend_name_2 ← "Random Row 2"
      Attributes ⎕PLOT Data

   Note that (for syntactical reasons) the separation between the line
attribute and the line number is _ (underscore) if A is specified as a
structured APL value and - (minus) if A is specified as a string of
lines.

   If the global attribute output_filename is given, then the plot is
not only being displayed in a window on the screen, but also written to
a file with the name of the file provided as attribute value.  *Note
Output File Format::, below.

   For example:

      ⊣ ( ⊂ "output_filename: /tmp/bitmap.png" ) ⎕PLOT 1 3 1 4 2

   writes the plot of a a zigzag curve to file /tmp/bitmap.png (Caution:
⎕PLOT with attribute output_filename overrides existing files without a
warning).  Lack of permissions to write the file raises a DOMAIN ERROR
with )MORE possibly providing details.

   Some line attributes such as line_width or point size are frequently
the same for several or all plot lines.  In that case one can use the
line attribute without a -N resp.  _N suffix which is then used for all
lines (unless overridden by the same attribute with -N resp.  _N suffix.

2.31.3 Plot Window Handling
---------------------------

Each call of ⎕PLOT with some plot data B opens a separate window in the
X server (which implies that ⎕PLOT requires X). That window runs in its
own thread until it is being closed.  A plot window can be closed in
different ways:

   • by clicking on the close button (often located near the top-right
     corner) of the window,
   • by opening the drop down menu of the window (near the top left-of
     the window) and selecting the option named "Close",
   • from APL by calling ⎕PLOT ¯3 (which closes all open plot windows),
     or
   • from APL by calling ⎕PLOT H (which closes a specific plot window),
     where H is the plot window handle returned by monadic ⎕PLOT B or by
     dyadic A ⎕PLOT B with plot attributes A.

   Note that the exact method for closing a plot window with the mouse
(as opposed to ⎕PLOT ¯3 or ⎕PLOT H from APL) differs between different
window managers.  The above stands for the standard method(s) for
closing windows on your system.

2.31.4 Output File Format
-------------------------

Early versions of ⎕PLOT were using libxcb to display the results of
⎕PLOT while recent versions use libgtk-3.  The primary driver for this
change was the lack of full Unicode support in libxcb which made it, for
example, difficult to properly display APL characters in window captions
or in plot line legends.

   Writing the pixels of a plot to a file uses functions provided by
either libxcb or libgtk-3, and these functions generate different file
formats.

   libxcb is the older of the two libraries and it therefore produces
the older file format .bmp (bitmaps).  libgtk-3 is the newer library and
it procuces the somewhat newer file format .png (portable network
graphics).  There are tools like convert from package imagemagick that
can be used to convert different image file formats into each other and
therefore this incompatibility should not cause too much trouble.

   For backward compatibility, the libxcb option for ⎕PLOT will continue
to exist for some time, but bug fixes and new features will only be made
for the libgtk-3 option.

2.32 ⎕PS - Print Style
======================

⎕PS is an integer vector that currently (read: as of SVN 982) contains
two integers which control some details of how APL values are being
printed.  The default value of ⎕PS is 0 0.  ⎕PS is a session variable
which survives )LOADing of workspaces

   ⎕PS[1] = 0: print rational quotients a normal floating point numbers

   ⎕PS[1] = 1: print rational quotients as A÷B

   Note: ⎕PS[1] has only an effect if rational numbers were
./configure’d.

   ⎕PS[2] = 0: no "boxing" of APL values

   ⎕PS[2] > 0: "boxing" of APL values according to ⎕PS[2].

   Setting ⎕PS[2] has the same effect as the debug command ]BOXING and
uses the same values.

   Note: For compatibility with older workspaces, assigning a single
value to ⎕PS assigns that value to ⎕PS[2] and sets ⎕PS[1] to 0.

2.33 ⎕RE - Regular Expressions
==============================

⎕RE is a function that provides access to a subset of libpcre2, which is
a powerful regular expression matching library.  "pcre" is an acronym
for "Perl compatible regular expressions".  libpcre2 is Copyright (c)
1997-2017 University of Cambridge, England.

2.33.1 Preconditions
--------------------

libpcre2 is NOT shipped with GNU APL but must be installed before the
GNU APL ./configure script is executed.  The ./configure script tries to
locate libpcre2 and enables ⎕RE if the library (and its header files)
are found.

   If ./configure does not find libpcre2, then ⎕RE will raise a SYNTAX
ERROR when ⎕RE is used in an APL program.

2.33.2 Syntax
-------------

⎕RE has two forms.  The short form (without an axis argument) is
intended to cover the most likely use cases of ⎕RE, while the long form
gives more control over the format of the result produced by ⎕RE:

Z ← A ⎕RE B      (short form, no axis)
Z ← A ⎕RE[X] B   (long form, with axis X)

   The short form is equivalent to the long form with an empty axis:

    A ⎕RE B   ←→   A ⎕RE[''] B

   It therefore suffices to explain the long form.  The long form has 3
different arguments A, B, and X.

2.33.3 The Regular Expression A
-------------------------------

A is a simple character vector which is expected to be a regular
expression as defined for the libpcre2 library.  ⎕RE passes its left
argument A unmodified to libpcre2.  The format of A ranges from very
simple REs to very complex REs.  In fact, regular expressions are a
language of their own, and it is impossible to describe them here.  The
user of ⎕RE is referred to the description that comes with libpcre2.

   See in particular: man pcre2pattern

2.33.4 The String(s) B Being Matched
------------------------------------

B is either:

  1. a simple character vector (which is then also passed unmodified to
     libpcre2), or

  2. a (nested) APL array consisting of simple character vectors.

   In the second case above, the result of ⎕RE is conceptually the same
as if the EACH operator had been applied to ⎕RE:

    A ⎕RE B   ←→   A ⎕RE ¨ B

   The libpcre2 first compiles A into an internal representation that
improves the matching (of B) speed.  As a consequence, if several
strings shall be matched with the same regular expression A, then it is
(sometimes considerably) faster to A ⎕RE B once with several items of a
nested B, than to A ⎕RE B multiple times with the same A but different
Bs.  This is in particular the case when longer text files with many
lines shall be matched.

   If multiple (nested) strings B are used then A is compiled once and
after that the different ⊃B[i] in B are passed unmodified to libpcre2.
In that case the result Z is nested and (⍴B) ≡ (⍴Z←A ⎕RE[X] B). We can
therefore limit the description to the case where B is a simple
character vector.

   Any string B that is passed to libpcre2 is called "Subject" in the
libpcre2 documentation.

2.33.5 The Flags X
------------------

By default, i.e.  without an axis argument X or - equivalently - with an
empty string X←"" as axis argument, ⎕RE returns the first match of the
regular expression A in the string B as an APL string.

   By means of the optional axis argument X ≢ "" (in the following
called flags) one can change the default behavior in order to adapt
various aspects of the matching to satisfy the requirements that the
user of ⎕RE may have.

   The X argument of A⎕RE[X] B is a character vector where each
character is a flag.  Each flag is either understood by (and then passed
unmodified to) libpcre2 or else understood by ⎕RE itself (and then not
passed to libpcre2).

2.33.5.1 The libpcre2 flags: i, m, s, and x
...........................................

The libpcre2 flags accepted by ⎕RE are: i, m, s, and x.  They correspond
to the following libpcre2 flags:

   • i: PCRE2_CASELESS (perform case insensitive matching)
   • m: PCRE2_MULTILINE (perform matching across multiple lines)
   • s: PCRE2_DOTALL (dot (.)  in A also matches CR/LF)
   • x: PCRE2_EXTENDED (see ’man pcre2pattern’)

   Please consult the libpcre2 documentation for a more detailed
description of these flags.

2.33.5.2 The ⎕RE (APL output format) flags ↓, ⊂, and /
......................................................

⎕RE provides different output formats, some of which are tailored to
different APL functions, so that these other APL functions can use the
result of ⎕RE without major conversions .  There are currently 4
different output formats:

   • no ⎕RE flag: ⎕RE returns the matching sub-string(s) of B.

   • ↓ flag: ⎕RE returns the position(s) and the length(s) of the
     matched sub-string of B, Like other left arguments of ↑ or ↓, the
     string position(s) in the result start at 0 (i.e.  not at ⎕IO) and
     can therefore be used directly by dyadic ↓ and ↑.  For instance to
     cut out the matched pieces.

   • ⊂ flag: ⎕RE returns an integer vector suitable as the left argument
     of partition (dyadic ⊂).

   • / flag: ⎕RE returns an Boolean vector suitable as the left argument
     of compress (dyadic /).

   The following examples may better explain the nature of the output
flags:

      ⍝ return (first) matched string
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE[''] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━┓
┃foo┃
┗━━━┛

      ⍝ return (first) pair (position, length)
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['↓'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━┓
┃2 3┃
┗━━━┛

      ⍝ return left argument A of A ⊂ B
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['⊂'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

      ⍝ return left argument A of A / B
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['/'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   In the absence of a ’g’ flag (see below) the results of output
formats ⊂ and / are identical; if ’g’ is present, however, then they may
differ.

2.33.5.3 the ⎕RE global flag g
..............................

The default behavior of ⎕RE is to return only the first match of A in B.
The ’g’ flag causes ⎕RE to return all matches instead.  For example:

      ⍝ return first match as string
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE[''] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━┓
┃foo┃
┗━━━┛

      ⍝ return all matches as strings
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['g'] '__foo___fun____fox'

┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

      ⍝ return all matches as left argument of ⊂ (aka. partition)
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['⊂g'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

      ⍝ return first match as left argument of / (aka. compress)
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['/'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

      ⍝ return all matches as left argument of / (aka. compress)
      4 ⎕CR 'f..' ⎕RE['/g'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   Please note that the ’g’ flag increments the depth of the result of
the output formats ’string’ and ’position/length’, but not of the result
of output formats ’partition’ and ’compress’.

   The output formats ⊂ and / are related like this:

      A ⌷RE['/'] B   ←→   0 ≠ A  A ⌷RE['⊂'] B

2.33.5.4 the ⎕RE error flag E
.............................

The default behavior of ⎕RE is to return an empty result if no match of
the regular expression A is found in B. It is sometimes more convenient
to raise an error if no match is found.  This can be achieved with the E
flag:

       4 ⎕CR 'g..' ⎕RE[''] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏⊖┓
┃0┃
┗━┛
       'g..' ⎕RE['E'] '__foo___fun____fox'
DOMAIN ERROR+
      'g..' ⎕RE['E']'__foo___fun____fox'
      ^            ^
      )MORE
No match

   The ’E’ flag has no effect if the ’g’ flag is also given because in
that case it is natural to check the length of the result:

      4 ⎕CR 'g..' ⎕RE['Eg'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏⊖┓
┃0┃
┗━┛


2.33.6 Complex Matches
----------------------

The regular expressions considered so far were simple, which means that
they did not have (regular) sub-expressions.  In other words, the
regular expression A did not contain non-literal (unquoted) parentheses.
However, the libpcre2 allows sub-expressions and ⎕RE follows suit to a
certain extent.  If A contains sub-expressions, then the result A ⎕RE
becomes deeper, and the structure of the result is determined by the
structure of the parentheses in A.

   The result of a general regular expression A is recursively
constructed by ⎕RE as follows:

   1.  If A contains no sub-expressions then the result is constructed
as described in the previous sections.

   2.  If A contains sub-expressions, say A1, ...  An, then the result
is a (nested) vector with N+1 elements where the first element is the
entire match (which contains the sub-matches) and the following elements
are the next-level sub-matches.

   Since the sub-matches are contained in their parent matches, it makes
no sense to handle sub-matches in the partition and compress output
formats.  For the string and pos+len formats, the following examples may
give an insight as to how the results look like.

   The regular expression A ← ’f(.)(.)’ used in the example below is a
top-level regular expression which contains two 1-character
sub-expressions (.).  The result is therefore the top-level match plus
two 1-character sub-matches:

      4 ⎕CR 'f(.)(.)' ⎕RE[''] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃┏→━━┓ ┏→┓ ┏→┓┃
┃┃foo┃ ┃o┃ ┃o┃┃
┃┗━━━┛ ┗━┛ ┗━┛┃
┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   Matching all instead of only the first then gives:

      4 ⎕CR 'f(.)(.)' ⎕RE['g'] '__foo___fun____fox'
┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┏→━━━━━━━━━━━━┓┃
┃┃┏→━━┓ ┏→┓ ┏→┓┃ ┃┏→━━┓ ┏→┓ ┏→┓┃ ┃┏→━━┓ ┏→┓ ┏→┓┃┃

┃┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ ┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ ┗∊━━━━━━━━━━━━┛┃
┗∊∊━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

   The same for the pos+len output format:

2.34 ⎕RVAL - Random APL value
=============================

The standard way to produce random numbers is the primitive function ?
aka.  Roll.  Roll returns a simple random array whose ravel elements are
positive integers chosen in a (pseudo-) random fashion.  While this is
sufficient for many applications, one sometimes needs APL values whose
randomness not only affects the ravel elements themselves, but also
other aspects like:

   • the rank of the value,
   • the shape of the value,
   • the data type of the ravel elements, and
   • the depth (nesting) of the values.

   Such values can be produced with system function ⎕RVAL. The main use
case for ⎕RVAL is the production of test data for the interpreter, but
⎕RVAL might be useful for other purposes as well.

2.34.1 General
--------------

In general, monadic ⎕RVAL B, returns a single random APL value Z, while
dyadic A RVAL B is used to control the properties of subsequently
generated random APL values returned by monadic ⎕RVAL.

   The typical use of ⎕RVAL is to firzt call A ⎕RVAL B zero or more
times to override individual default properties of the subsequently
produced values, followed by one or more calls of monadic ⎕RVAL B.

   The default properties, i.e.  the properties used unless they were
overridden by A ⎕RVAL B are:

Rank:  0
Shape: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (unused since Rank = 0)
Type:  0 1 0 0 0       (only integers
Max. Depth: 4

   The default properties therefore return an integer scalar for every
call of ⎕RVAL B.

2.34.2 Dyadic ⎕RVAL
-------------------

The left argument A of A ⎕RVAL B determines which aspect of the
subsequent random APL values shall be controlled.  A is an integer
scalar:

   • A=0 controls the state of the underlying random number generator,

   • A=1 controls the ranks of the subsequent random APL values,

   • A=2 controls the shapes of the subsequent random APL values,

   • A=3 controls the data types in the ravels of the subsequent random
     APL values, and

   • A=4 controls a maximum depth of the subsequent random APL values.

2.34.2.1 0 ⎕RVAL B: Control of the underlying random number generator
.....................................................................

⎕RVAL uses the standard C function random_r().  For this reason ⎕RVAL is
only available on platforms which use glibc, for example all GNU/Linux
system.

   Every random number generator has a state (similar to ⎕RL for ’?’).
While the primitive ?  keeps its state in ⎕RL, i.e.  in the workspace,
⎕RVAL has no associated system variable like ⎕RL which keeps its state.
Instead, the user needs to store the state of ⎕RVAL in a workspace
variable if the workspace shall be stored and continued at a later
point.  This rarely happens, therefore no effort was spent for
implementing another system variable.  For the same reason, the state of
⎕RVAL survives )CLEAR.

   The current state of ⎕RVAL’s random number generator can be retrieved
with:

      STATE ← 0 ⎕RVAL ''

   The state changes with every call of monadic ⎕RVAL. The random number
generator can later be restored to the same state like this:

      0 ⎕RVAL STATE

   Restoring the state is needed when the same sequence of random value
shall be generated again.  The random number generators of ?  and ⎕RVAL
are indepentent; generating a random number or random value with one
does not change the state of the other.

2.34.2.2 1 ⎕RVAL B: Control of the ranks
........................................

The rank of subsequently generated random values can be controlled with
1 ⎕RVAL B as follows.

   • If B is a non-negative scalar B with 0 ≤ B < MAX_RANK then the
     subsequently generated random values will have the fixed rank B.
     MAX_RANK is a ./configurable constant with a default of 8.

   • If B is a negative scalar B with 0 > B > -MAX_RANK then the ranks
     of the subsequently generated random values will be chosen at
     random between 0 and -B (including).  All possible ranks 0 ...  B
     will have the same probability P = 100÷1-B %.

   • Otherwise B must be a vector of positive integers.  The integers
     are the relative frequencies of the ranks 0, 1, ...  MAX_RANK
     respectively.  Too many integers (i.e.  MAX_RANK > ⍴B) will raise a
     LENGTH ERROR while fewer (than MAX_RANK) are set to 0.

   1 ⎕RVAL always returns its previous setting (i.e.  before applying
B). An empty B, e.g.  1 ⎕RVAL ⍬ will not change anything and can be used
to query the current setting for 1 ⎕RVAL.

   Examples:

   • 1 ⎕RVAL 2 will produce only matrices,

   • 1 ⎕RVAL ¯2 will produce scalars, vectors or matrices, each with a
     probability of 100÷3 %, and

   • 1 ⎕RVAL 50 30 20 will produce a scalars with probability 50%,
     vectors with probability 30%, and a matrices with probability 20%.
     The numbers need not add up to 100, but will be scaled accordingly.

2.34.2.3 2 ⎕RVAL B: Control of the shapes
.........................................

The shapes of subsequently generated random values can be controlled
with 2 ⎕RVAL B as follows.

   B must be a vector of positive or negative integers.  Vectors longer
than MAX_RANK + 1 will give a LENGTH ERROR while vectors shorter than
MAX_RANK + 1 will be filled with 1 until the length of B becomes
MAX_RANK + 1.

   If an element B_{i} of the resulting shape B = B_{1} ...  B_{MAXRANK}
is ≥ 0 then the corresponding axis i will have a fixed length of B_{i}.
If B_{i} < 0 then the length of that axis will be chosen at random with
a probability of 1÷B_{i}.  Note that the same B can still produce
different shapes even if all B_{i} are ≥ 0 (i.e.  if the rank is also
chosen at random).

   2 ⎕RVAL always returns its previous setting (i.e.  before applying
B). An empty B, e.g.  2 ⎕RVAL ⍬, will not change anything and can be
used to query the current setting for 2 ⎕RVAL.

   Example:

1 ⎕RVAL 2        ⍝ produce matrices
2 ⎕RVAL 3 ¯10    ⍝ the first axis of every matrix will have length 3, and
                 ⍝ the last axis of every matrix will vary between 0 and 10

   This will produce scalars, vectors with a fixed length of 3 and
matrices with 3 rows and between 0 and 10 columns.

2.34.2.4 3 ⎕RVAL B: Control of the data types
.............................................

The types (i.e.  CHARACTER, INTEGER, REAL, COMPLEX, or NESTED) of
subsequently generated random values can be controlled with 3 ⎕RVAL B as
follows.

   B must be a vector with up to 5 positive numbers, corresponding to
the types.  Shorter vectors are filled with 0 (the corresponding types
will not occur) and longer vectors will raise a LENGTH error.

   Once the type was chosen, th ravel item will be:

   • for type CHARACTER: a random character with ⎕UCS between 0 and
     $3000 (excluding).  Larger Unicodes typically cause display
     problems.  If you need larget Unicodes, use ⎕UCS with random
     integers.

   • for type INTEGER: a random integer with ⎕UCS between -$80000000 and
     $7FFFFFFF.

   • for type REAL: a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0
     (excluding)

   • for type COMPLEX: a complex point number with real and imaginaty
     part between 0.0 and 1.0 (excluding), and

   • for type NESTED: a nested APL value with the same properties (rank,
     shape, and type) as their parent.

   3 ⎕RVAL always returns its previous setting (i.e.  before applying
B). An empty B, e.g.  3 ⎕RVAL ⍬ will not change anything and can be used
to query the current setting for 3 ⎕RVAL.

   Example:

      1 ⎕RVAL 2         ⍝ produce matrices
      2 ⎕RVAL 3 3       ⍝ produce 3×3 matrices
      3 ⎕RVAL 0 50 50   ⍝ produce a mix of integer and real values
      ⎕RVAL ''
¯975954163190248487                   0.5892132425
7677327503669503253 2152001972871424768

2.34.2.5 4 ⎕RVAL B: Control of a maximum depth
..............................................

If the probability of generating a nested value is > 0 then the depth of
random values can become arbitrarily large and could therefore exceed
the system limit for the depth of the random value being produced.  This
can be prevented by setting a maximum depth for every value generated.
⎕RVAL sets the probability of the deepest allowed depth to 0.

   4 ⎕CR B expects B to be a positive integer which is deepest allowed
depth;

   An empty B, e.g.  4 ⎕RVAL ⍬, will not change anything and can be used
to query the current setting for 4 ⎕RVAL.

2.34.2.6 monadic ⎕RVAL B: Return a new random value
...................................................

Calling ⎕RVAL monadically produces one new random APL value.

   The properties of that next value can be controlled by the dyadic
calls of ⎕RVAL as described above.  If no prior dyadic call of ⎕RVAL was
made then the properties have the following defaults:

      1 ⎕RVAL ⍬    ⍝ rank (scalar)
0

      2 ⎕RVAL ⍬    ⍝ shape (not used since rank = 0)
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

      3 ⎕RVAL ⍬    ⍝ types (integer)
0 1 0 0 0

      4 ⎕RVAL ⍬    ⍝ max. depth (not used since probasbility of NESTED = 0)
4

   That is, by default ⎕RVAL ⍬ produces random integer scalars.

   It is sometimes convenient to be able to change the properties of the
next random value without modifying (and later restoring) the properties
with dyadic ⎕RVAL. This can be achieved with monadic ⎕RVAL with
non-empty B.

   Let 4=⍴B. Then

   Z←⎕RVAL B does essentially:

   B[1]←1 ⎕RVAL B[1]
   B[2]←2 ⎕RVAL B[2]
   B[3]←3 ⎕RVAL B[3]
   B[4]←4 ⎕RVAL B[4]

   Z←⎕RVAL ''

   B[1]←1 ⎕RVAL B[1]
   B[2]←2 ⎕RVAL B[2]
   B[3]←3 ⎕RVAL B[3]
   B[4]←4 ⎕RVAL B[4]

   If 4>⍴B then the missing properties are not changed.

   Examples:

⎕RVAL 1 (,¯4) (0 1)    ⍝ return a random 0-4 element integer vector
⎕RVAL 2 (2 2) (1 0)    ⍝ return a random 2×2 character array

2.35 ⎕SQL - SQL Database Interface
==================================

As of GNU APL 1.6, the native function SQL has been replaced by the
system function ⎕SQL, described below.  ⎕SQL has an axis argument that
selects a sub-function of ⎕SQL.

2.35.1 ⎕SQL[0] : display subfunctions
-------------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[0]''
Available function numbers:
type  ⎕SQL[1] file      - open a database file, return reference ID for it
      ⎕SQL[2] ref       - close database
query ⎕SQL[3,db] params - send SQL query
query ⎕SQL[4,db] params - send SQL update
      ⎕SQL[5] ref       - begin a transaction
      ⎕SQL[6] ref       - commit current transaction
      ⎕SQL[7] ref       - rollback current transaction
      ⎕SQL[8] ref       - list tables
ref   ⎕SQL[9] table     - list columns for table

2.35.2 ref ← A ⎕SQL[1] B : open database
----------------------------------------

      type  ⎕SQL[1] file

   Connect to database of type A using connection arguments B. The
result is a database handle ref to be used in the other ⎕SQL functions.

   A must be a string indicating the database type.  Currently supported
values are ’postgresql’ and ’sqlite’.

   B is the connection parameters which depends on the type of database:

   - For type≡’sqlite’: the argument is string pointing to the database
file.

   - For type≡’postgresql’, the argument is a standard connect string as
described in the PostgreSQL documentation.

   This function returns a database handle that should be used when
using other SQL functions.  This value should be seen as an opaque
handle.  It is, however, guaranteed that the handle is a scalar value.

2.35.3 ⎕SQL[2] B : close database
---------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[2] ref

   Disconnect from database ref.

   B is the database handle that should be disconnected.  After this
function has been called, no further operations are to be performed on
this handle.  Future calls to ⎕SQL[1] may reuse previously disconnected
handles.

2.35.4 Z ← A ⎕SQL[3, ref] B : database query (with result)
----------------------------------------------------------

      query ⎕SQL[3, ref] params

   Execute a select statement and return the result table.

   The axis parameter indicates the database handle.

   A is a select statement to be executed.  Positional parameters can be
supplied by specifying a question mark "?"  in the statement.

   B is an array containing the values for the positional parameters.
If the array is of rank 2, the statement will be executed multiple times
with each row being the values for each call.

   The return value Z is a rank-2 array representing the result of the
select statement.  Null values are returned as ⍬ and empty strings are
returned as ”.

2.35.5 Z ← A ⎕SQL[4, ref] B : database query (w/o result)
---------------------------------------------------------

      query ⎕SQL[4, ref] params

   Execute an SQL statement that does not return a result.

   This function is identical to SQL∆Select with the exception that it
is used on statements which do not return a result table.

2.35.6 ⎕SQL[5] B : start transaction
------------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[5] ref

   Begin a transaction.

2.35.7 ⎕SQL[6] B : commit transaction
-------------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[6] ref

   Commit a transaction.

2.35.8 ⎕SQL[7] B : rollback transaction
---------------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[7] ref

   Rolls back the current transaction.

2.35.9 Z←⎕SQL[8] B : table names
--------------------------------

      ⎕SQL[8] ref

   Return an array containing the name of all tables.

2.35.10 Z←⎕SQL[9] B : column names
----------------------------------

      ref  ⎕SQL[9] table

   Return an array containing information about the columns in the given
table.  Currently, the column layout is as follows:

   Name Type

   More columns containing extra information may be added in a future
release.

2.36 ⎕SI - State Indicator
==========================

⎕SI returns aspects of the current State Indicator, similar to the
standard command )SI. This can be used, for example, to create debug
functions similar to the assert() macro in C/C++:


∇Assert B;COND;LOC;VAR
 →(1≡B)⍴0
 ' '
 COND←7↓,¯2 ⎕SI 4
 LOC←,¯2 ⎕SI 3
 '************************************************'
 ' '
 '*** Assertion (', COND, ') failed at ',LOC
 ''

 ⍝ show stack
 ⍝
 ' '
 'Stack:'
 7 ⎕CR ⊃¯1↓⎕SI 3
 ' '
 '************************************************</pre>'
 →
∇


   The right argument of ⎕SI specifies which aspect of the State
Indicator shall be returned:

   • ⎕SI 1: The name of the context.  That name is either:
        • the name of a defined function, or
        • ◊ for an immediate execution context, or
        • ⍎ for an execute context.

   • ⎕SI 2: The line number (of a defined function) or 0 for immediate
     execution and execute contexts.

   • ⎕SI 3: The function name and line number in square brackets, for
     example: "FOO[3]"

   • ⎕SI 4: Either the statement text of the function line or the error
     text of an error that has occurred on the line

   • ⎕SI 5: The program counter (= token number counted from the start
     of the function text)

   • ⎕SI 6: the parse mode of the context (immediate execution, execute,
     or defined function).

   If no left argument is provided then the result of ⎕SI is a vector
with one entry per State Indicator level (and hence ⍴⎕SI B is the depth
of the SI stack).

   If the optional left argument A is provided then it specifies a
particular level of the SI instead of the entire SI. A should be an
integer scalar.  If A is positive then the level is counted from the
oldest entry to the latest, while negative A count from the latest to
the oldest level.

   For example, ¯1 ⎕SI refers to the currently executing context, ¯2 ⎕SI
is the caller, and so on.

2.37 ⎕SYL - System limits
=========================

System variable ⎕SYL shows a number of system limits when referenced:

      ⎕SYL
 SI depth limit          (0 = no limit)                    0 
 number of values limit  (0 = no limit)                    0 
 total ravel bytes limit (0 = no limit)                    0 
 current SI depth                                          1 
 current number of values                                 54 
 current total ravel bytes                              9072 
 max. rank for APL values                                  8 
 min. ⎕PW                                                 30 
 max. ⎕PW                                               1000 
 min. ⎕PP                                                  1 
 max. ⎕PP                                                 16 
 max. input line length                                 2000 
 hash table size (obsolete)                            65536 
 max. shared variable name length                         64 
 max. length of filenames (paths)                       4096 
 max. # of shared variables (obsolete)                    64 
 max. number of APs                                       16 
 max. operators per statement                             16 
 largest integer                         9000000000000000000 
 smallest integer                       ¯9000000000000000000 
 largest numeric exponent                                308 
 max. shared variable size (bytes)                     65000 
 max. cores (per ./configure)                              0 
 max. cores (per max_cores())                              1 
 current cores (per core_count())                          1 
 print length limit (0 = no limit)                         0 

   Most system limits are read-only; attempting to assign ⎕SYL will
result in a SYNTAX ERROR. Indexed assignment to ⎕SYL will result in an
INDEX ERROR unless the limit is writable.  Some read-only limits can be
changed at compile-time via ./configure

2.37.1 ⎕SYL[1 2 3 4 5 6;]
-------------------------

The first three limits are writable; their purpose is to stop execution
if:

  1. The SI stack of the interpreter reaches a limit, or
  2. The number of APL values created reaches a limit, or
  3. The memory size of APL values created reaches a limit.

   Whenever a writable limit is reached, a corresponding LIMIT ERROR is
reported and the limit is reset to 0 (meaning no limit) in order to
prevent that the interpreter gets locked up.

   The main use of ⎕SYL is to troubleshoot infinite recursion in
user-defined function that would otherwise cause the machine to start
swapping or to become non-responding.

   Example (stop execution if function call stack exceeds 20):

      ⎕SYL[1;2]←20

   Note that small APL values (up to a configurable number of ravel
elements) count as values (in the number of values limit), but not in
the total ravel bytes limit (the ravel does not allocate memory in
addition to the space already in the number of values limit).  It is
therefore typical to set the number of values limits and the total ravel
bytes limits together.

   An attempt to set a too small limit, for example one that is close to
the current value, is rejected with a DOMAIN ERROR.

2.37.2 ⎕SYL[7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23;]
-------------------------------------------------------------

These system limits are read-only.  Some of them can be changed at
compile time via ./configure.  Most others can be changed in the source
code of GNU APL, but doing so is not recommended.

2.37.3 ⎕SYL[24 25 26;]
----------------------

These system limits have been added in preparation of multi-core GNU
APL. They are currently not used.

2.37.4 ⎕SYL[27;]
----------------

This is not a limit that raises a limit error.  Instead it limits the
size of APL values when printed as statement results.  It is fairly easy
in APL to create huge APL values by mistake.  During development it can
be useful to limit the amount of data printed.  If the ravel length of,
say, VALUE exceeds ⎕SYL[27;2] (i.e.  if ⎕SYL[27;2] ≤ ⍴,VALUE) then
SH↑VALUE is printed instead of VALUE. The shape SH is computed like
this:


      SH←⍴VALUE
      while (ravel-length(SH) ≥ ⎕SYL[27;2])   { divide longest axis in SH by 2 }

2.38 ⎕XML - XML Parsing
=======================

2.38.1 Purpose
--------------

GNU APL provides ⎕XML as a means of performing elementary manipulations
of APL character strings that are formatted according to the XML
standard.  The anticipated procedure for such modifications is something
like:

      XML_string ← "<A><B><C>Hello</C></B></A>"   ⍝ input data (usually from an .xml file)
      APL ← ⎕XML XML_string       ⍝ convert XML_string to associative array APL
      ABC ← APL.a.b.c             ⍝ retrieve node a.b.c in APL
      APL.a.b.c ← ABC, " World"   ⍝ modify node a.b.c in APL
      Z ← ⎕XML APL                ⍝ convert associative array APL to XML string Z

      ABC   ⍝ the original value of XML.a.b.c
Hello
      Z     ⍝ the modified XML string
<A><B><C>Hello World</C></B></A>"

   The scope (functionality) of ⎕XML is then:

   • Conversion of (valid) XML strings to associative APL arrays that
     can be more easily processed in APL than the XML strings,
   • Conversion of associative APL arrays back to valid XML strings,
   • Simple (at APL level) access to the data contained in the XML
     strings, and
   • Transparent access to those (mostly XML specific) portions of the
     XML string that are not (yet) handled by ⎕XML; this means that the
     user of ⎕XML shall be able to handle advanced XML aspects (like
     document type declarations (DTDs), document validation, etc.)
     herself in APL and without much ovehead.

2.38.2 Some XML Terminology
---------------------------

An XML document is a character string with a standardized format.  The
characters must be valid XML characters as defined in the XML standard
(almost all Unicode characters except most of the ASCII control
characters).  GNU APL raises a DOMAIN ERROR when an XML document
contains invalid XML characters.

   The XML document is a sequence of adjacent sub-strings, where each
sub-string is:

   • either markup (-string),
   • or non-markup (-string).

   A markup (sub-)string:

   • starts with character ’<’, and
   • ends with character ’>’, and
   • all other characters in the markup string differ from ’<’ and ’>’.

   A non-markup (sub-)string:

   • starts either at the beginning of the XML document or else directly
     after a markup string,
   • end at the end of the document or else directly before a markup
     string, and therefore
   • cannot be adjacent to another non-markup string.

   Non-markup is sometimes referred to as "unstructured text".  The
producer of an XML document has a principal choice as to where to put
the information that the document contains is located: in the
unstructured text or in the atttribute values inside the tags.  For that
reason the XML standard is somewhat picky about keeping the unstructured
text as well as attribute values intact and requires that whitespace in
non-markup (the only allowed whitspace characters in XML being TAB, CR,
LF, and SPACE) is preserved in non-markup strings.

   As a consequence, many non-markup strings begin with LF because the
preceeding markup was on the previous line and therefore the LF after
the preceeding markup is whitespace of the non-markup and therefore
needs to be preserved.

   Every markup belongs to one of 4 categories:

   • Processing instructions: "<?  ...  ?>",
   • Comments: "<!— ...  —>",
   • Declarations "<!  ...  !>", and
   • Tags, which are either:
        • Empty tags (leaf tags): "<tagname attributes...  />
        • Start tags: "<tagname attributes...  >, or
        • End tags: "</tagname>

   The XML tags recursively define a tree structure where:

   • the nodes of the trees are either Empty Tags or else a start tag,
     followed by a (possibly empty) sequence of non-markup, comments,
     and sub-nodes (of the tree), followed by an end tag (with the same
     name as the start tag),
   • the leafs of the trees are either Empty Tags or else a start tag,
     followed by a (possibly empty) sequence of non-markup and comments,
     followed by an end tag (with the same name as the start tag)> The
     difference between a leaf node and a non-leaf is therefore the
     absence of sub-nodes between a start and an end tag.
   • optionally non-markup and comments before, after, and between the
     nodes.

   Processing instructions and declarations are typically located at the
beginnning of the XML document and at the same level as the root of the
tree.  defined by the document.  Document type declarations are being
preserved (so that they can be processed in APL), but are currently
ignored by ⎕XML. As a consequence, entity declarations have no effect
and only the predefined XML entities (i.e.  &, <, >, ’, and ") are
recognized (and translated) by ⎕XML.

2.38.3 How ⎕XML maps XML documents to APL Values
------------------------------------------------

The principal mapping between XML strings and APL values is:

   • XML document ←→ structured (top-level) APL value or variable (= an
     associative array)
   • XML node ←→ structured APL (sub-) value (= an associative (sub-)
     array of either the top-level value or of another XML node)
   • XML name ←→ name of a member in a structured APL value
   • Other ←→ member value

   Every valid name in XML is also a valid name for an APL variable or
structure member.  Unfortunately, mapping XML names directly to APL
member names cannot work because:

   • In any associative array are the names of the members necessarily
     distinct.  Assigning a value to an already existing member of a
     structured value overrides the icurrent value of that member
     instead of creating a second member with that value.  On the other
     hand, in XML nodes tags may (and frequently do) occur repeatedly.
     If an XML document contains several nodes with the same tag, then
     the applications usually knows how to interpret the order in which
     the tags occur, but this order may not be detectable at the XML
     level (i.e.  the nodes may not only have the same tag names, but
     also the same attributes and attribute values).

     The applications that use the XML document frequently require that
     the order of XML nodes with the same name remains intact when the
     document is modified.  For example, the entries of a telephone book
     may be sorted alphabetically without XML being aware of that.
     Reading, modifying, and writing back the data in the telephone book
     must therefore not destroy that order.

   • Likewise, at least for readability reasons, the order if XML the
     order of nodes attributes, should not be changed.  XML documents
     are frequently processed with text tools like diff which would
     incorrectly show differences between XML documents that are
     equivalent from an XML perspective.

   • Conflicts between tag names and attribute names.  In XML, the same
     name can designate an attribute in one node and a tag in another
     node.  ⎕XML keeps all information from the < of a start tag to the
     > of an end tag in a single associative array, therefore the
     attribute names must somehow differ from the (sub-) tag names.

   • Every XML node has a tag name that can be used to derive a
     corresponding APL member name.  However, the text segments between
     an XML tag and its corresponding end tag, are a mixture of
     unstructured text, XML subnodes and comments of which only the XML
     subnodes have tags of their own.  These untagged segments may,
     however, contain relevant information and, from an XML standard
     perspective, both their content and their order must be preserved.

   ⎕XML solves these issues with a simple naming convention for all
member names in the (recursive) associative array that is produced by
monadic ⎕XML. Every member name consists of 3 components that together
yield a valid APL variable name (and therefore a valid member name that
is understood by the APL parser):

   • A single character ⍙, ∆, or _, that indicates the role of the name
     in the XML document as follows:
        • the character ⍙ characterizes an attribute name, i.e.  a names
          that was used inside (i.e.  between < and >) of an XML start
          or leaf tag.  The character ⍙ alone is the name of a special
          member which is present in every associative array below the
          top-level and whose value is the original XML tag name of a
          tag, or

        • the character ∆ characterizes a name that was synthesized by
          ⎕XML itself in order to tag a text (sub-) segment that has no
          tag of its own.  corresponding XML entity was not a tag (and
          therefore had no tag name), or

        • the character _ characterizes the name of an XML entity, i.e.
          an CML name that occur between the start tag and the
          corresponding end tag (if any: leaf tags have no such entities

   • a position prefix of the form NN, where NN is the position of the
     member in relation to the tag to which it belongs.  The numbering
     starts at ⎕IO and restarts at every XML start or leaf tag.

   • the attribute name or tag name.  For those parts of an XML parts
     that do not have a tag name, the member name is being synthesized
     by ⎕XML and the member value will be the text in the XML document
     with predefined XML entities replaced by their single characters,
     i.e.:
        • & for &amp,
        • < for &lt,
        • > for &gt,
        • ’ for &apos,
        • " for &quot,
        • ⎕UCS nnn for &#nnn, and
        • ⎕UCS $xxx for &#xxx

   Let NN be a sequence of decimal digits.  Then only the following 4
synthesized names are produced by ⎕XML:

   • ∆NNcomment for XML comments, i.e.  <!— ...  —> in XML,
   • ∆NNdeclaration for XML declarations, i.e.  <?  ...  ?> in XML,
   • ∆NNdoctype for document type declarations, i.e.i <!DOCTYPE ...  >
     in XML
   • ∆NNtext for unstructured (and hence untagged) text segemnts in XML.

   Every XML name (of a tag or attribute) is also a valid APL name, but
valid APL names may also contain the characters ¯, ∆, and ⍙ which are
not valid in XML and used in the naming convention above to clearly
separate the member names used in APL from the names used in the XML
document.

   The essence of all this is that everything that belongs to an XML
node or document, i.e.  the attributes inside a tag, the sub-nodes
between a start tag and its corresponding end tag (if any),
declarations, etc.  will be contained in a single associative array.

   Examples of APL member names (assuming ⎕IO←1):

      ⍙1              ⍝ the first member in every XML node. Its value is the node tag.
      ∆1declaration   ⍝ the first member in most XML documents. E.g. <?xml version= ...>
      ∆2text          ⍝ whitespace (LF) between _1∆declaration and _3∆doctype
      ∆3doctype       ⍝ DTD in XML documents that have one. E.g. <!DOCTYPE  ...
      _6Workspace     ⍝ Sub-array for <Workspace ... at position 6.
      ⍙1wsid          ⍝ first attribute wsid from e.g. <Workspace wsid=...
      ⍙2year          ⍝ second attribute year

2.38.4 Monadic ⎕XML
-------------------

Z ← ⎕XML B converts APL string B that contains a valid XML document to
an associative APL array Z and vice versa.

   Note: If you convert an associative APL array back to a an XML
document, then the result is a possibly very long strings with
containing several linefeed characters.  That is OK if the string is
written to a file, but causes problems when the string is being
displayed and longer than ⎕PW. The standard APL folding of output near
⎕PW make the string then look somewhat garbled.  This effenct can be
suppressed in 2 ways:

  1. set ⎕PW large enough, or
  2. prefix the string with ⊃35⎕CR as in the examples below.

2.38.5 Dyadic ⎕XML
------------------

Z ← A ⎕XML B provides a number of convenience functions.  Its left
argument A is an interger function number, possibly followed by
arguments of the function number ↑A.

   In the following examples, let

      XML←36 ⎕CR """
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <Document>
    <Tag1 name='tag1'>   <!-- first tag -->
      TEXT1
      <Subtag name='subag1.1'>   <!-- first subtag -->
        SUBTEXT1_1
      </Subtag>
    </Tag1>
  </Document>
"""

APL←⎕XML XML

   Then

   • Z←0 ⎕XML B is the same as monadic Z←⎕XML B.

   • Z←1 ⎕XML B is like 0 ⎕XML B, except that B is not the XML document
     (string) itself but the name of a file from which an XML document
     is read.

   • Z←2 ⎕XML B splits an APL member path (a sequence of member names)
     into a vector P of (nested) member names.  This vector P is
     understood by the ASPL primitive PICK (i.e.  Z←P⊃APL or
     (P⊃APL←value) and can be used to address the data in an XML node.

   • Z←3 ⎕XML B splits an APL member name (as produced by e.g.  monadic
     ⎕XML into a 3-item vector Z. Z[1] is a single character indicating
     the category (i.e.  a character scalar ∆, ⍙, or _).  Z[2] is the
     position (an integer scalar ≥ ⎕IO). Z[3] is a (nested) APL string.
     3 ⎕XML has an inverse function ¯3 ⎕XML which converts a 3-item
     vector as produced by 3 ⎕XML back into an APL member name.

     indicating the category (i.e.  _, ∆, or ⍙) and the name from the
     XML tag:

                 8 ⎕CR (C P N)←3 ⎕XML "∆2comment"
     ┌→────────────┐
     │∆ 2 ┌→──────┐│
     │    │comment││
     │    └───────┘│
     └∊────────────┘
     
           C   ⍝ category
     ∆
           P   ⍝ position
     2
           N   ⍝ (XML-) name
     comment
     
           ¯3 ⎕XML C P N   ⍝ inverse of 3 ⎕XML
     ∆2comment
     

   • Z←4 ⎕XML B is a string that shows the member names of the
     associative array B in a tree-like fashion.  For example:

           ⊃35⎕CR 4 ⎕XML APL
     XML                     
      │                      
      └─── Document          
            │                
            └─── Tag1        
                  │          
                  └─── Subtag

   • Z←5 ⎕XML B is like 4 ⎕XML but displays not only the XML tags but
     also other XML nodes (declarations, attributes, etc.):

           ⊃35⎕CR 5 ⎕XML APL
     XML                               
      │                                
      ├─── _1∆declaration              
      ├─── _2∆text                     
      └─── _3_Document                 
            │                          
            ├─── _1∆text               
            ├─── _2_Tag1               
            │     │                    
            │     ├─── _1∆text         
            │     ├─── _2∆comment      
            │     ├─── _3∆text         
            │     ├─── _4_Subtag       
            │     │     │              
            │     │     ├─── _1∆text   
            │     │     ├─── _2∆comment
            │     │     └─── _3∆text   
            │     └─── _5∆text         
            └─── _3∆text               

   • Z←6 ⎕XML B is like 4 ⎕XML but displays not only the member name but
     the entire path to the member:

           ⊃35⎕CR 6 ⎕XML APL
     XML                                             
      │                                              
      └─── ._3_Document                              
            │                                        
            └─── ._3_Document._2_Tag1                
                  │                                  
                  └─── ._3_Document._2_Tag1._4_Subtag

   • Z←7 ⎕XML B returns a list of all members in a depth-first order.
     This list can be used as an iterator to traverse the entire tree
     (and possibly filter out items along the way).

           ⊃7 ⎕XML APL
     ._1∆declaration                          
     ._2∆text                                 
     ._18∆text

     ._3_Document._1⍙                         
     ._3_Document._1∆text

     ._3_Document._2_Tag1._4_Subtag._2∆comment
     ._3_Document._2_Tag1._4_Subtag._3∆text   

   • Z←8 ⎕XML B is like Z←7 ⎕XML B, except that only the aubset of those
     members that are related to tags (the tag name ⍙ and tag
     attributes) are returned:

           ⊃8 ⎕XML APL   ⍝ all tag related member names (tag names and attributes)
     ._3Document.⍙1····················
     ._3Document._2Tag1.⍙1·············

     ._3Document._2Tag1._4Subtag.⍙1····
     ._3Document._2Tag1._4Subtag.⍙2name

   • Z←9 ⎕XML B is like Z←7 ⎕XML B, except that only the aubset of
     synthesized members other than ∆text are returned:

           ⊃9 ⎕XML APL   ⍝ all synthetic member names (except unstructured text)
     .∆1declaration·······················
     ._3Document._2Tag1.∆2comment·········
     ._3Document._2Tag1._4Subtag.∆2comment

   • Z←10 ⎕XML B is like Z←7 ⎕XML B, except that only the aubset of
     synthesized ∆text members are returned:

   • Z←11 ⎕XML B is like Z←7 ⎕XML B, except that only the tag names are
     returned:

           ⊃11 ⎕XML APL   ⍝ all tag member names
     ._3Document················
     ._3Document._2Tag1·········
     ._3Document._2Tag1._4Subtag

   • Z←12 ⎕XML B is like Z←7 ⎕XML B, except that all member names of B
     are returned without descending into sub-tree:

           ⊃12 ⎕XML APL   ⍝ all member names (7 ⎕XML, but non-recursive)
     .∆1declaration
     .∆2text·······
     ._3Document···
     .∆18text······

     This variant may also be useful for structured variables that were
     not created by ⎕XML.

   • Z←13 ⎕XML B shows the (flat) tag names in B, but but does not
     descend into any sub-tree if B.

          ⊃13 ⎕XML APL   ⍝ all tag members (8 ⎕XML, but non-recursive)
      ._3Document 

   • Z←(14 "member-name") ⎕XML B shows the next member in B after
     "member-name".  It can be used as an iterator that walks through
     the tags.  an empty member name returns the first member:

           APL ← ⎕XML XML←"<ROOT><A/><B/><C/></ROOT>"
     
           (14 "") ⎕XML APL._1ROOT   ⍝ get first memebr in APL._1ROOT
     ⍙1
           (14 "⍙1") ⎕XML APL._1ROOT   ⍝ next member after APL._1ROOT.⍙1
     _1A
           (14 "_1A") ⎕XML APL._1ROOT   ⍝ next member after APL._1ROOT._1A
     _2B
           (14 "_2B") ⎕XML APL._1ROOT   ⍝ next member after APL._1ROOT._2B

2.38.6 XML Queries
------------------

The different functions in dyadic ⎕XML are intended to construct XML
queries.  An XML query extracts information from, or modifies
information in, an XML document.  XML queries may differ considerably in
their details, but usually follow these top-level steps:

  1. Read an XML document into, say, APL (APL←0 ⎕XML B or APL←1 ⎕XML B)
  2. Optionally, display the structure of the document (3, 4, or 5 ⎕XML)
  3. Select a subset of XML nodes (= GNU APL member names, 6 ⎕XML APL)
  4. retrieve or modify the data in the selected XML nodes (with
     something like MEMBERS←(⊂APL) FUN¨6⎕XML APL←⎕XML followed by
     MEMBER⊃ )
  5. Optionally, convert the modified XML document back to XML (0 ⎕XML

3 Limitations and Missing Features
**********************************

GNU APL is an almost full implementation of the ISO standard 13751.
However, a few limitations exist.  See file README-4-compliance for an
up-to-date descriptions of limitations.

3.1 System Limits
=================

APL floating point values are 64-bit wide, thus ranging from -8.98E307
to 8.98E307.

   GNU APL integers have a guaranteed range from -9200000000000000000 to
9200000000000000000, which is a slighly smaller range.

   A 64-bit integer represents a value between -9223372036854775808L and
9223372036854775807.

   If the result of a computation is integer by nature, for example +,
-, or × with integer arguments, and falls into the guaranteed range,
then the result will be an APL integer.  If the result is to large for a
64-bit signed integer then the result will be automatically converted to
an APL floating point value.  However, if the result is outside the
guaranteed range but still within the 64-bit integer range, e.g.
between i(excluding) 9200000000000000000 and 9223372036854775807, then
GNU APL gives no guarantees as to whether the result will be a 64-bit
integer or as a 64-bit floating point (and then loosing precision).
This decision is usually function-specific and driven by performance
considerations.

   APL values have a maximum rank of 8.  However, the maximum range can
be by means of ./configure (see README-2-configure).

3.2 Shared Variables
====================

The system functions and variables related to shared variables, i.e.
⎕SVO, ⎕SVR, ⎕SVC, ⎕SVS, and ⎕SVQ, are implemented.

   Communication between two workspaces is supported, but with some
limitations.  Two workspaces can only communicate via shared variables
if they (i.e.  their processes) run on the same machine.

   However, only two auxiliary processors, AP100 and AP210, are provided
as examples of how to implementing auxiliary processors in GNU APL.

   Shared variables for auxiliary processors are provided for some
backward compatibility.  In the past - without access to the source code
of the APL interpreter - shared variables were the only method available
to extend the functionality of the interpreter.

   With this interpreter - and access to its source code - it is often
more convenient to add your own commands or your own system variables to
the APL interpreter rather that adding auxiliary processors.

4 Internationalization
**********************

GNU APL used to be internationalized by means of GNU gettext, but is not
anymore.

   For APL characters to work properly with keyboards and terminal
emulators (see also README-3-keyboard) it is essential that your LANG
environment variable is correctly set.  For German, that would be
"de_DE.utf8", like:

   $export LANG=de_DE.utf8

   A misspelling of the language can cause APL characters to become
unavailable, even if your xmodmap is correct.  You can check your
setting by executing the program ’locale’.  If it shows warnings like
these:

locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory

   then something is wrong and you should check your LANG setting and
installed locales.

   As far as xterm is concerned, the xterm command line options –u8,
–lc, and –en might solve problems related to the terminal.

5 Project Structure
*******************

The top-level directory of the GNU APL project has a structure like
this:

    apl-1.8/
    ├── autom4te.cache
    ├── build
    ├── debian
    ├── debian_tmp
    ├── devel_doc
    ├── doc
    ├── erlang
    ├── gnu-apl.d
    ├── HOWTOs
    ├── html
    ├── m4
    ├── rpm
    ├── src
    ├── support-files
    ├── tools
    ├── websock
    ├── workspaces
    ├── wslib2
    ├── wslib3
    ├── wslib4
    └── wslib5

   Most of these directories are contained in the project tar file (e.g.
apl-1.8.tar.gz) and some are created during the build of GNU APL. Only
the directories in the top-level are shown above.

   The GNU APL project follows the standard layout for autoconf/automake
projects.  The top-level itself contains the files needed by
autoconf/automake and a handful of README-XXX files that might be of
interest when building GNU APL.

   The subdirectories are (in order of decreasing relevance):

* Menu:

* Section 5.1:: The subdirectory src
* Section 5.2:: The subdirectory support-files
* Section 5.3:: The subdirectory doc
* Section 5.4:: The subdirectory HOWTOs
* Section 5.5:: The subdirectories workspaces and wslib2 ... wslib5
* Section 5.6:: The subdirectory m4
* Section 5.7:: The subdirectories rpm, debian, and debian_tmp
* Section 5.8:: The subdirectory tools

5.1 The subdirectory src
========================

The subdirectory src contains all C++ source files that are needed to
build either the GNU APL interpreter itself, or libapl (a library that
contains the essential part of GNU APL, but without the interactive REPL
loop of the interpreter).  During the build, the object files produced
by the compiler are also placed in this directory.

   The subdirectory src contains further subdirectories for components
of GNU APL that are optional and typically require the installation of
additional libraries on the build machine.  The ./configure script in
the top-level directory determines, which optional components shall be
included on the build.

   GNU APL comes with an automated test suite, the testcases are
contained in subdirectory src/testcases


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.2,  Next: Section 5.3,  Prev: Section 5.1,  Up: Chapter 5

5.2 The subdirectory support-files
==================================

The subdirectory support-file contains a number of configuration files
that aim at making a standard keyboard produce APL characters.  Details
are explained in top-level file README-3-keyboard.


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.3,  Next: Section 5.4,  Prev: Section 5.2,  Up: Chapter 5

5.3 The subdirectory doc
========================

The subdirectory doc is used to create this info file in different file
formats (.info, .html).


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.4,  Next: Section 5.5,  Prev: Section 5.3,  Up: Chapter 5

5.4 The subdirectory HOWTOs
===========================

The subdirectory HOWTOs contains some documents that try to explain how
some of the non-standard features of GNU APL are supposed to be used.
These documents were written for two different audiences: APL
programmers and GNU APL hackers.  The documents for APL programmers are,
by default, installed in directory /usr/local/share/doc/apl by make
install while the documents for GNU APL hackers (i.e.  C++ programmers
or trouble-shooters) are not installed by make install, but rather
remain in the source tree.


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.5,  Next: Section 5.6,  Prev: Section 5.4,  Up: Chapter 5

5.5 The subdirectories workspaces and wslib2 ... wslib5
=======================================================

These directories (and their content) are, by default, copied to
/usr/local/lib/apl by make install.  Some subdirectories are empty while
others contain small workspaces or libraries for various purposes
(mostly demonstrating the use of some non-standard APL features).


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.6,  Next: Section 5.7,  Prev: Section 5.5,  Up: Chapter 5

5.6 The subdirectory m4
=======================

The subdirectory m4 contains macros used by autoconf and automake.  In
most cases the top-level ./configure script can be used as is.  If a
platform on which GNU APL shall be built differs to much from the
platform on which the GNU APL project tar file (e.g.  apl-1.8.tar.gz)
was created, then it might be necessary to re-create the ./configure
script on the platform.

   Re-creating the ./configure script requires:

   • the installation of autoconf,
   • the installation of automake,
   • the installation of libtool,
   • maybe running aclocal, libtoolize, and other scripts, and finally
   • running autoreconf


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.7,  Next: Section 5.8,  Prev: Section 5.6,  Up: Chapter 5

5.7 The subdirectories rpm, debian, and debian_tmp
==================================================

These subdirectories are templates for building (binary) RPM resp.
Debian packages that contain GNU APL. Subdirectory debian_tmp is
initially empty and acts as a scratch directory inside which the
interpreter is being compiled when a Debian package is built.


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 5.8,  Prev: Section 5.7,  Up: Chapter 5

5.8 The subdirectory tools
==========================

GNU APL uses generated C++ code.  The subdirectory tools contains the
source code for the code generator (phrase_gen) and also some other
small tools for various purposes.  These tools are typically used by GNU
APL hackers and are therefore not installed by make install.

6 Libraries Contributed by GNU APL Users
****************************************

Since the first release of GNU APL, a number of libraries, but also
other developments, have been made by users of GNU APL. Below are links
to these contributions.

* Menu:

* Section 6.1::  The GNU APL Community Webpage
* Section 6.2::  Core Libraries


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 6.1,  Next: Section 6.2,  Up: Chapter 6

6.1 The GNU APL Community Webpage
=================================

The GNU APL project maintains a web page that lists contributions made
by GNU APL users:

   <http://www.gnu.org/software/apl/Community.html>

   The contributions listed there were collected from emails sent to
bug-apl@gnu.org

   Since the list was started long after bug-apl@gnu.org was created.
It is therefore quite possible that your contribution is missing.  That
does not mean that your contribution was not considered worthwhile to be
listed but more likely that it was overlooked.  Just send an email to
bug-apl@gnu.org to fix that.


File: apl.info,  Node: Section 6.2,  Prev: Section 6.1,  Up: Chapter 6

6.2 Core Libraries
==================

There is a small number of libraries that are considered "core" APL
because, for example, the ISO standard requires their functionality, or
because other APL interpreters normally support them.

   These libraries are linked via the GNU APL Community web page.  In
addition they are stored in the GNU APL SVN repository and also included
in the GNU APL packages that follows their contribution.

   Currently the following core libraries exist:

   GNU APL Emacs mode (for Emacs users) by Elias Mårtenson

   SQL interface (SQLite and Postgres) by Elias Mårtenson

   Component File System (as required by ISO 13751) by David B. Lamkins

   Component File System (as required by ISO 13751) by Blake McBride

   SQL

7.1 The GNU Free Documentation License
======================================

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     non-commercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

7.2 The GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==================================

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0.  Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making
of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list meets this criterion.

   1.  Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,
or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

   2.  Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
it unnecessary.

   3.  Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

   4.  Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   5.  Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any
other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond
what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate.

   6.  Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone
who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding
Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on
a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless
of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the
product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,
or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.
Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source
code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking,
reading or copying.

   7.  Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not
survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find
the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way.

   8.  Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

   9.  Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   10.  Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the
work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding
Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   11.  Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s "contributor version".

   A contributor’s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business
of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and
under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
be available to you under applicable patent law.

   12.  No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
conveying the Program.

   13.  Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

   14.  Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

   15.  Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16.  Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   17.  Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an
absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it
does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.  This is free
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
