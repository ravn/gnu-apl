Your code goes here. The HTML headers above make sure that APL characters are
properly displayed. The encoding of this file should be UTF-8 (as produced,
for example, the GNU APL command )DUMP.

After your code, you MAY want to add one of the following lines:

   )OFF        ⍝ exit the apl interpreter
   ]NEXTFILE   ⍝ end of APL in this file (but stay in the interpreter).

   The )OFF command is typically used by scripts and applications )LOADed.

   The ]NEXTFILE command is typically used by code that is COPYed.

   Both )OFF and ]NEXTFILE allows for longer descriptions after the command.
   The interpreter stops reading input at the )OFF or ]NEXTFILE command,
   but the HTML output remains visible when the files is being browsed.

⍝ EOF &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
