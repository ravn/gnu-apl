<H1>Introduction</H1>

This directory contains small files that contain APL code fragments,
APL functions, entire APL workspaces, or files that are otherwise related
to GNU APL, and that the author of the file would like to share with other
APL users (GNU APL or not).
<BR><BR>
The files are self-contained in the sense that no other information about
them is required or available. Some files are GNU APL workspaces (created
with the )DUMP command) while others are meant for direct cut-and-paste
from a web browser into GNU APL without the need to download them first.
<BR><BR>
Please note that the files are NOT maintained by the GNU APL project but
by the author named in each file.

<H1>File Format</H1>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   <A href=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>RFC 2119)</A>
<BR><BR>
All files MUST be HTML and UTF8-encoded.
<BR><BR>
Every file MUST contain the following information (preferably at the
beginning as APL comments):
<UL>
<LI> Author
<LI> Date
<LI> Copyright
<LI> License
<LI> Support email address
<LI> Portability
<LI> Purpose
<LI> Description
</UL>

There is a file <A href="+TEMPLATE-Bits_and_Pieces.apl">
+TEMPLATE-Bits_and_Pieces.apl</A> in this directory that can serve as a
template for contributions of APL code. The details of the mandatory
information in a file is described in the following sub-chapters.

It MAY be a good idea to add meta tags into the &lt;HEAD;&gt; section of
the HTML header. The author SHOULD use an HTML validator before submitting
a file.

<H3>Author</H3>

The author is the name of the person that has written the code. It MUST NOT
be the name of a legal entity (company, corporation etc.). The author MAY
provide additional information like postal address, but should keep in mind
that this information will be visible on the internet.
<BR><BR>
The author is responsible for the content of the file. The author (and NOT
the GNU APL project) is also responsible for maintaining the file.

<H3>Date</H3>

The date when the file was submitted to the GNU APL Bits_and_Pieces
directory (see <A href="#CH_2">Process </A> below).

<H3>Copyright</H3>

The file MUST contain a copyright line like:
<BR><BR>
Copyright (C) 2015 by Author
<BR><BR>
with, of course, <B>2015</B> and <B>Author</B> replaced by the actual date and
name. We currently assume that the author is also the copyright owner. If the
author differs from the copyright owner then we need to check with the GNU
project how to handle the contribution.

<H3>License</H3>

The file MUST declare under which license it is being published. The license
MUST be either GPL or LGPL at the discretion of the author.

<H3>Support email</H3>

The file MUST contain an email address to which support requests (questions
and bug reports) should be sent. Since this email address appears on the internet,
the author MAY obscure it in a way that is easy to understand by human readers
but difficult to handle by programs that scan the internet automatically.

<H3>Portability Level</H3>

A file containing APL code MUST indicate its portability level, which is
one of:
<UL>
<LI> L1: runs on all ISO 13751 compatible APL interpreters
<LI> L2: like L1, but needs an additional portability library
<LI> L3: runs only on GNU APL
</UL>

See <A href=http://www.gnu.org/software/apl/Library-Guidelines.html>
Library Guidelines</A> for details.

<H3>Purpose</H3>

This should be a brief description of WHAT the code does.

<H3>Description</H3>

This should be a description of HOW the code is supposed to be used.
<BR><BR>
In general, more is better. However a too long description at the beginning of
the file can reduce the readability of the file considerably. For that
reason it is recommended to put a brief description at the beginning of
the file and a longer, more detailed description at the end. This can be
achieved by ending the APL code with command )OFF or with command ]NEXTFILE.
After )OFF or ]NEXTFILE you can then add the long description (without
worrying about performance because the interpreter stops processing of the file
at the )OFF or ]NEXTFILE command.

<H1>Process</H1><A name="CH_2"></A>

If you would like to share a file by publishing it in the the GNU APL
GNU APL Bits_and_Pieces directory, then please do the following.
<OL>
<LI> Prepare the file according to the format described above
<LI> Send an email to <a href="mailto:bug-apl@gnu,org">bug-apl@gnu,org</a>
     with the file attached and declaring that (1) you are the author of the
     file and (2) you would like it to be published in the GNU APL
     Bits_and_Pieces directory. In that email, please solicit feedback from
     the GNU APL Community on your contribution.
<LI> We will then look at the file (checking that the format of the file is
     as described above, that it does not conflict with the
     <A href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">GNU philosophy</A>,
     and that it is suitable for the GNU APL Bits_and_Pieces directory).
     We will then either accept the file, request modifications, or reject it.
<LI> If the file is accepted then send a release announcement to
     <a href="mailto:bug-apl@gnu,org">bug-apl@gnu,org</a> (and possibly other
     places as appropriate).
</OL>

<H1>Removal</H1>

There could be reasons to remove a file, for example if the support email
address becomes invalid, support requests are not answered, or the code in
the file is obsoleted by other contributions.
<BR><BR>
We will, if possible, inform the author of a file before removing it.
<BR><BR>
The author of a file can also, at any time, request the removal of the file.
