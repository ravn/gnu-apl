<H1>Introduction</H1>

This directory contains small files that contain APL code fragments,
APL workspaces, or files that are otherwise related to GNU APL, and that
the author of the file would like to share with other APL users (GNU APL
or not).

The files are self-contained in the sense that no other information about
them is available. Some files are GNU APL workspaces (created with the )DUMP
command) and others are meant for direct cut-and-paste from a web browser into
GNU APL without the need to download them first.

<H1>Format</H1>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

All files MUST be HTML and UTF8-encoded. Every file MUST contain the
following information (preferably at the beginning as APL comments):
<UL>
<LI> author
<LI> copyright
<LI> license
<LI> support email
<LI> compatibility
<LI> purpose
<LI> description
</UL>
