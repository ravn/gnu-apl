    <B>GNU APL</B> is a free interpreter for the programming language APL.
    <BR><BR>
    The APL interpreter is an (almost) complete implementation of
    <I><B>ISO standard 13751</B></I> aka.
    <I><B>Programming Language APL, Extended.</B></I>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    The APL interpreter has implemented:
    <UL>                                        <LI> nested arrays and related functions  <LI> complex numbers, and                 <LI> a shared variable interface        </UL>                                     
    
    In addition, <B>GNU APL</B> can be scripted. For example, this
    GNU APL home page was produced by a CGI script written in APL (see
     <A href="APL_demo.html"><B>APL demo</B></A> ).

    GNU APL was written and is being maintained by Jürgen Sauermann.

Therefore an interpreter downloaded from a GNU mirror is inevitably outdated and likely contains errors that were fixed already. Consider using <B>git</B> or <B>SVN</B> (see below) instead.</OL>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    
     <H4>GNU APL for WINDOWs</H4> 
    
    GNU APL compiles under CYGWIN, (see
    <A href="http://www.cygwin.org">www.cygwin.org</A>),
    provided that the necessary libraries are installed. A 32-bit <B>apl.exe</B>
    that should run under CYGWIN lives in the download area. Use at your own risk
    and see <B>README-5-WINDOWS</B> for further information. Building GNU APL under
    cygwin is the method of choice if you need some of the special purpose system
    functions (⎕FFT, ⎕PLOT, ⎕RE, etc) that depend on non-default libraries.
    
    A compiled 64-bit version of GNU APL (briefly tested under Windows 10)
    which was built under cygwin, but runs without cygwin being installed,
    is contained in file <B>apl-1.8-windows.zip</B>. This zip file also contains
    an installer for an APL keyboard layout.
    
     <H4>Subversion (SVN) and Git repositories for GNU APL</H4> 
    
    The best supported way of installing GNU APL is to check out its latest version from either its Subversion (preferred)
    or Git repository on Savannah. The subversion command to do that is:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>svn checkout http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/svn/apl/trunk</B>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Here is  <A href="https://savannah.gnu.org/svn/?group=apl"><EM>more information</EM></A> 
    about using Subversion with GNU APL. Likewise, the command for a Git
    checkout is:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/apl.git</B>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    and here is  <A href="https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=apl"><EM>more information</EM></A> 
    about using Git with GNU APL.
    
     <H4>RPMs for GNU APL</H4> 
    
    For RPM based GNU/Linux distributions we have created source and binary RPMs.
    Look for files <B>apl-1.8-0.i386.rpm</B> (binary RPM for i386) or 
    <B>apl-1.8-0.src.rpm</B> (source RPM). If you encounter a problem with these
    RPMs, then please report it, but with a solution, since the maintainer of
    GNU APL may use a GNU/Linux distribution with a different package manager.
    
     <H4>Debian packages for GNU APL</H4> 
    
    For Debian based GNU/Linux distributions we have created source and binary 
    packages for Debian. Look for files <B>apl-1.8-1_i386.deb</B> (binary Debian
    package for i386) or <B>apl-1.8-1.debian.tar.gz</B> (Debian source package).
    If you encounter a problem with these packages, then please report it,
    but with a solution, since the maintainer of GNU APL may use a GNU/Linux
    distribution with a different package manager.
    
     <H4>GNU APL Binary</H4> 
    
    If you just want to quickly give GNU APL a try, and if you are very lucky,
    then you may be able to start the compiled
    GNU APL binary <B>apl</B> in the directory <B>apl</B> rather than
    installing the entire packet . The binary MAY run on a 32-bit i686 Ubuntu.
    Chances are, however, that it does NOT work, Please DO NOT report any
    problems if the binary does not run on your machine. Instead please use a better
    supported installation method above.
    <BR><BR>
    <B>Note:</B> The programs <B>APxxx</B> and <B>APserver</B> (support programs for
    shared APL variables) are not provided in binary form. Therefore you should
    start the <B>apl</B> binary with command line option <B>--noSV</B>. Note as
    well that the binary <B>apl</B> will not be updated with every GNU APL release.
    Therefore it will contain errors that have been corrected already.

    <DIV class="c4">
     <H2>Reporting Bugs</H2> 
    
    GNU APL is made up of more than 100,000 lines of C++ code. In a code of that
    size, programming mistakes are inevitable. Even though mistakes are hardly
    avoidable, they can be <B>corrected</B> once they are found. In order to
    improve the quality of GNU APL, we would like to encourage you to report
    errors that you find in GNU APL to
     <A href="mailto:bug-apl@gnu.org"><EM>bug-apl@gnu.org</EM></A> .
    <BR><BR>
    The emails that we like the most are those that include a small example of
     how to reproduce the fault. You can see all previous postings to this mailing
    list at

    <DIV class="c5">
     <H2>Documentation</H2> 
    We have an  <A href="apl.html"><B>info manual</B></A>  for GNU APL.
    
    We are also looking for <B>free</B> documentation on APL in general
    (volunteers welcome) that can be published here. A "Quick start" document
    for APL is planned but the work has not started yet.
    <BR><BR>
    The C++ source files for GNU APL are Doxygen documented. You can generate
    this documentation by running <B>make DOXY</B> in the top level directory
    of the GNU APL package.

    <DIV class="c6">
     <H2>GNU APL Community</H2> 
    There is a growing group of people that are using GNU APL and that have made
    their own developments related to APL available to the public.
    We have created a
    <A href="Community.html"><b>GNU APL Community Web page</b></A>
    that collects <B>links</B> to those developments to avoid that they get lost.
    <BR><BR>
    In addition, we maintain a 
    <A href="Bits_and_Pieces/"><b>Bits-and-Pieces</b></A> directory
    where we collect <B>files</B> that contain APL code sniplets, GNU APL
    workspaces, and other files that were contributed by the GNU APL Community.
    The Bits-and-Pieces directory is the right place for contributions for which
    the creation of an own hosting account would be an overkill.
