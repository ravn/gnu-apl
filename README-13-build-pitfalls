The following is a collection of pitfalls that were observed when
building GNU APL:


1. libapl with âŽ•FFT support (thanks to Chris Moller)
----------------------------------------------------

If you build libapl, i.e. you ./configure GNU APL like:

    ./configure --with-libapl ...

and build libfftw3 from source (e.g. from fftw-3.3.10.tar.gz),

then you need to make sure that not only the static library (i.e.
/usr/local/lib/libfftw3.a) but also the shared libraries (i.e.
libfftw3.so are being built and installed. The default ./configure
of libfftw3 seems to only build the static libraries on some platforms.

To do so, ./configure libfftw3 (not GNU APL!) like:

    ./configure --enable-shared

When libfftw3 is installed from a Debian package (as opposed to building
from source) then the shared libraries will most likely be installed and
no further action is required.

The advice above is supposedly also valid for other libraries that augment
the functionality of GNU APL.
