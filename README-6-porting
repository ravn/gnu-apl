GNU APL has been compiled successfully on non-GNU/Linux systems.
Some of these systems may require additional settings.

Below are notes from GNU APL users with non-GNU/Linux systems (in
alphabetical order of the OSs)

We have seen two problems building GNU APL in FreeBSD.
Both can be solved by ./configure'ing GNU APL as shown below.

1. Non-standard library locations. Some of the libraries used by GNU APL.
   for example libexecinfo, live in /usr/local/lib and not in /usr/lib and
   are not found by ./configure. This can be solved by setting LDFLAGS
   BEFORE running ./configure.

2. GNU APL needs libreadline with Unicode support. The libreadline in FreeBSD
   seems to have Unicode support disabled, which causes APL characters entered
   on the keyboard to be corrupted. This can be solved by ./configure option
   --without-readline (typically combined with --disable-nls, which also
   influences character input).

After compiling GNI APL you may want to enable UTF-8 encoding for your
terminal. For example, in xterm you need enable UTF-8 encoding and
UTF-8 Fonts in xterm's VT menu (Ctrl + right mouse). It may be possible
to set this permanently in your terminal's configuration file(s).

Freebsd 8.4

Many thanks to Sam Sirlin for providing this!

for configure:
--------------

setenv CC gcc46
setenv CXX g++46
setenv LDFLAGS '-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/gcc46 -R/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib/gcc46'
setenv LIBS ' -llapack -lblas  -lgfortran -lexecinfo ' 
./configure --without-readline --disable-nls

Freebsd 9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

setenv LDFLAGS '-L/usr/local/lib'
./configure --without-readline --disable-nls

The latest version (SVN) of GNU APL was reported to compile and run on OS-X
without special measures.
