GNU APL has been compiled successfully on non-GNU/Linux systems.
Some of these systems may require additional settings.

Below are notes from GNU APL users with non-GNU/Linux systems (in
alphabetical order of the OSs)

We have the following problem building GNU APL in FreeBSD.
It can be solved by ./configure'ing GNU APL as shown below.

1. Non-standard library locations. Some of the libraries used by GNU APL.
   for example libexecinfo, live in /usr/local/lib and not in /usr/lib and
   may not be found by ./configure. This can be solved by setting LDFLAGS
   BEFORE running ./configure.

After compiling GNU APL you may want to enable UTF-8 encoding for your
terminal. For example, in xterm you need enable UTF-8 encoding and
UTF-8 Fonts in xterm's VT menu (Ctrl + right mouse). It may be possible
to set this permanently in your terminal's configuration file(s).

Freebsd 8.4

Many thanks to Sam Sirlin for providing this!

for configure:
--------------

setenv CC gcc46
setenv CXX g++46
setenv LDFLAGS '-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/gcc46 -R/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib/gcc46'
setenv LIBS ' -lexecinfo ' 

Freebsd 9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

setenv LDFLAGS '-L/usr/local/lib'

The latest version (SVN) of GNU APL was reported to compile and run on OS-X
without special measures.

For Macintosh users, Peter Teeson has contributed a very nice installation
instructions that can be found in the doc/ subdirectory (file
APL-on-Macintosh.pdf).
