/**

  Multi-core GNU APL uses a pool of threads numbered 0, 1, ... core_count()-1

  (master-) thread 0 is the interpreter (which also performs parallel work),
  while (worker-) threads 1 ... are only activated when some paralle work
  is available.

  The worker threads 1... are either working, or busy-waiting for work, or
  blocked on a semaphore:

                      init
                       ↓
       blocked ←→ busy-waiting ←→ working

  The transitions

      blocked ←→ busy-waiting

  occur before and after the master thread waits for terminal input. That is,
  the worker threads are blocked while the master therad waits for terminal
  input.

  The transitions

        busy-waiting ←→ working

  occur when the execution of APL primitives, primarily scalar functions,
  suggests to execute in parallel (i.e. if the vectors involved are
  sufficiently long).

  In order to speed up the above transitions, they are not performed by
  the master thread (which would need O(P) cycles for fork()ing or join()ing
  P thrads) but by the worker threads (inluding the master) themselves.
  This brings down the fork/join() times from O(P) to O(log P). While this
  is not an issue for small core counts (like for a typical 4-core PC) we have
  seen this as a problem on an 80-core machine that we benchmarked.

  The TaskTree class manages the relation (who is fork()/join()ing whom) of
  the different threads. It is (re-)initialized only after core_count()
  has changed.
