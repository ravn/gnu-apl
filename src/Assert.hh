   #define macros Assert(cond) and Assert1(cond)

   All macros may (depending on ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED) evaluate the
   condition-expression cond. If cond is true (the expected case),
   then no more actions are performed.

   If cond is false (the unexpected case) then the macro will print a complaint
   show a stack-trace (both visible in APL). Interpretation of APL code will
   continue for the moment, but sooner or later the interpreter will crash.

   ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED = 0: neither Assert() nor Assert1() will complain
   ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED = 1: Assert() will complain. Assert1() will not
   ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED = 2: both Assert() and Assert1() will complain

   That is, higher ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED will raise more complaints.

   The default ./configure (intended for normal users) will have
   ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED = 0.

   The ./configure DEVELOP_WANTED=yes (aka. make develop) will have
   ASSERT_LEVEL_WANTED = 2.
