/**
  Multi-core GNU APL uses a pool of threads numbered 0, 1, ... core_count()-1

  (master-) thread 0 is the interpreter (which also performs parallel work),
  while (worker-) threads 1 ... are only activated when some parallel work
  is available.

  The worker threads 1... are either working, or busy-waiting for work, or
  blocked on a semaphore:

         init
          ↓
       blocked ←→ busy-waiting ←→ working

  The transitions

      blocked ←→ busy-waiting

  occur before and after the master thread waits for terminal input or when
  the number of cores is being changed (with ⎕SYL[26;2]). The workers are
  blocked while the master thread waits for terminal input. The reason for this
  is that a busy-waiting worker is consuming power for no reason (to the extent
  that the CPU fan turns on even though there is no useful work in sight).

  The transitions

        busy-waiting ←→ working

  occurs when the execution of APL primitives, primarily scalar functions,
  suggests to execute in parallel (i.e. if the vectors involved are
  sufficiently long).
