/**
 A named object is something with a name.
 The name can be user defined or system defined.

  User define names are handled by class Symbol, while
   system defined names are handled by class Id.

  User define names are used for (user-defined) variables, functions,
  or operators.

   System names are used by system variables and dunctions (⎕xx) and
   by primitive functions and operators.
