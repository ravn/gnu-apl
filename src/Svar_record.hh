{

/** shared variables control (what is NOT allowed). Terminology:
    _OFF: the parner that has first offered the variable,
    _ACC: the parner that has accepted the  offer
    _1: the partner reading ot changing the control vector
    _2: the other partner of _1 (if any)

   Normally the APL interpreter is _1 == _OFF and the
   partner is _2 == _ACC. If not (eg. when the partner offers first) then
   the functions set_control() and get_control() map the _1 and _2 arg (of
   set_control()) and result (of get_control()) to the proper _OFF and _ACC
   int in in the flags of the corresponding partner.
